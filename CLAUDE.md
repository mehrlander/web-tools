## How these instructions are split

The two imports above are the portable half: conventions that apply in any repo. [docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) is the general-behavior hub; [docs/SURFACING.md](docs/SURFACING.md) is the surfacing system (primitives plus the guide-PR/merge-guide course), split out because it was the bulk of the file. Both are canonical here; other repos load them via the `web-tools` skill (`.claude/skills/web-tools/SKILL.md`), which fetches both from main. Everything below is web-tools-specific, layered on top, including the repo's answers to the conventions' three extension points (preview mechanism, per-session refreshes, guide-PR support). Portable guidance goes in CONVENTIONS.md or SURFACING.md; web-tools machinery goes here.

CONVENTIONS.md is one of several docs written to travel; the full to-go bag (conventions, scripts, the headless-vendoring recipe, the sandbox notes) is catalogued in [docs/PORTABLE.md](docs/PORTABLE.md), which the loader skill points at and which points back. When adding a doc or script meant for reuse elsewhere, list it there.

## Preview mechanism: test page on a branch via `?use=`

GitHub Pages serves from one branch, typically main, so to render branch code through the canonical URL `lib/gh-api.js` honors a `?use=<branch|tag|sha>` query parameter: pages that adopt the convention read it at boot and load the rest of their code from that ref. Useful when linking the user to a test page that exercises work on a branch. See `README.md` for the canonical boot block.

Both `?use=` boots now fetch the reffed code from `raw.githubusercontent.com` and blob-import it, so a **branch name is cache-safe on every `?use=` page** and a fresh push previews immediately, no SHA needed. The **pre-build `dist/web-tools.js` boot** (show-repo, review, prebuild-demo) blob-imports the whole reffed bundle (see [tools/README.md](tools/README.md#the-pre-build)); the **`lib/gh-api.js` chain boot** (the ~18 other pages) blob-imports the reffed `gh-api.js`, which then loads the rest through the contents API at that ref (a `window.__ghBlobBoot` carrier hands repo/ref past the opaque `blob:` URL, since `import.meta.url` can no longer supply the ref). jsDelivr is used only where it is cache-stable or unavoidable: the no-`?use` `@main` default that every chain page imports (this repo's one CDN entry point), and the two bundle demos (`alpine-bundle-demo`, `vanilla-bundle-demo`), whose proof frames load lib via classic `<script src>` that raw's `text/plain` + `nosniff` cannot back, so their `?use=` handoff stays on jsDelivr.

This is the repo's **preview mechanism** for the conventions' ⭐ links: a changed page (or a component a page loads) previews live at

> `https://mehrlander.github.io/web-tools/pages/<page>.html?use=<ref>`

**What `?use=` swaps, and what it doesn't (the boundary with 🥏).** `?use=` only redirects the code a page *loads* (`gh.load(...)`, the `dist/` import): github.io still serves the **page file itself from main**, and only its downstream lib is pinned to the ref. So `?use=` previews branch work that lives in `lib/` or `dist/`, but **not** a change to a page's own inline shell (its markup, or an `x-data` defined inline in the file). For a page whose branch change is in the shell, `?use=` on the deployed URL runs main's old shell with branch lib and shows the pre-change page. Preview those with the **🥏 toss `#gh=` address mode** instead (`pages/toss-render.html#gh=mehrlander/web-tools@<ref>:pages/<page>.html`): it fetches the branch's actual file via the token, stamps a `?use` shim so the shell's own lib chain loads from `<ref>` too, and reroutes the page's relative deps and `fetch()`es to the same ref (see the `toss-render.html` head comment). So the rule of thumb: **lib/dist change → ⭐ `?use=`; page-shell change on an un-deployed branch → 🥏 toss `#gh=`.** A 🥏 link always points at `toss-render.html`, never at the page's own URL.

The honesty rule still applies: only a page renders this way; for a kit or doc, ⭐ links the `[new]` blob.

**Viewer context adds a third channel, the 📦 artifact.** Both 🥏 forms assume something about where the link opens: `#gh=` needs the viewer's browser to hold the `ghToken`. The Claude app's in-app browser keeps its own storage, so the token is not guaranteed there (historically absent, though it can be entered, after which `#gh=` works there too). Treat the token as possibly absent in the app: when it is, `#gh=` fails, so for a link the user will open there, bake the page self-contained (`bake-page` skill) and publish it as a 📦 artifact (renders on claude.ai sign-in, no token needed); 🥏 `#gz=` is the no-build fallback. Matrix and pipeline: [docs/artifacts.md](docs/artifacts.md).

## Per-session refresh: thumbnails

The conventions' wrap-up step 1 means one thing here: if any `pages/*.html` changed this session (`git diff main...HEAD --name-only`), regenerate just those pages' thumbnails (`npm run pages-shots -- <page…>`) and commit. Thumbs are refreshed once per session, not per commit: screenshots are slow and not byte-deterministic, so the commit hook only nags about them (see "Build-on-commit hook" below). The catalogs need no separate step; the hook regenerates them with each commit.

## Guide-PR support: platform auto-create is on

The Claude Code web settings for this account enable "Create pull requests automatically" with "Create as draft" (turned on 2026-07-10), so a session started after that gets its draft PR on first push; a session predating the toggle, or one working in an added repo, opens the draft itself via the GitHub MCP (the toggle was probed not to fire retroactively into an in-flight session). Body sync is by hand via `/caption`; no hook or CI tracks it. `BRANCH-GUIDE.md` files are historical (retired by PR #205); delete any stray one on sight.

## gh-api.js edits

Any turn that modifies `lib/gh-api.js` must end with the jsDelivr purge link so the user can flush the CDN cache with one tap:

> [https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/mehrlander/web-tools/lib/gh-api.js](https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/mehrlander/web-tools/lib/gh-api.js)

## The pre-build & the build-on-commit hook

`dist/web-tools.js` is **the pre-build**: the whole `lib/` frozen into one self-booting offline artifact, so a page can adopt the entire library with one import instead of a `gh.load` chain. It's generated (`npm run build:lib`) and it's the one tracked file under the otherwise-gitignored `dist/`. Full story in [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md#the-pre-build).

Every **deterministic** derived artifact is owned by one commit-time hook (`.claude/hooks/build-on-commit.sh`, a `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook wired in `.claude/settings.json`). Before a `git commit` it regenerates and stages, in the same commit, whatever the pending changes touch:

- `lib/` changed → `npm run build:lib` → `dist/web-tools.js`
- `pages/**/*.html` changed → `npm run pages-index` → `pages/README.md` + `pages/index.html`
- `tracker/tasks/` changed → `npm run tracker-board` → `tracker/board.md`

Don't hand-edit any of those four files; edit the source and let the hook refresh them. Thumbnails (`pages/thumbs/*.png`) are the deliberate exception: not byte-deterministic, so the hook only *warns* when a page changes without its thumb; the actual refresh happens once per session at wrap-up (see "Per-session refresh" above).

## Project tracker

Root-level `tracker/` scoped to repo-wide work (conventions, build tooling, docs, environment). Follows [`docs/TRACKER.md`](docs/TRACKER.md).

- **Placement:** `tracker/` (single tracker, no registry).
- **Board generator:** `npm run tracker-board` (wired into the commit hook above).

## Environment & testing

For visual changes, `npm run shot -- <page>` (`--ref` for `?use=`, `--script` for interactions) renders branch pixels headless; send the PNG into chat (conventions: "Show pixels").

[`docs/environment/`](docs/environment/) is a living, dated record of the Claude Code web environment, split by concern: [capabilities](docs/environment/capabilities.md) (network allowlist, headless browser, toolchain), [container](docs/environment/container.md) (what persists across sessions), [testing](docs/environment/testing.md) (the jsdom+Alpine recipe and page-preview constraints), and [extending](docs/environment/extending.md) (the Claude Code component model and the hooks this repo runs). Read it when a task involves testing, verifying, or reaching the network; extend it (edit in place, re-date) when you learn something new. Referenced by plain path, not `@`-imported, so it stays out of context until needed.
