# The loader — contract and extension notes

Most pages here load their own code at runtime instead of shipping a bundle:
a page imports `gh-api.js`, then calls `gh.load(...)` for each component and
kit it needs, and each file is fetched (through the GitHub contents API) and
run on the spot. There is no build step in the authoring loop — edit a file
in `lib/`, reload, and the next run uses it.

The repo has two tiers of pages:

- **Simple pages** (`pages/index.html`, `pages/stories/bookmarklets-story.html`,
  `show-repo/repo-drag.html`, `table-compress*.html`) — each is
  self-contained: CDN Tailwind + Phosphor + Alpine (via `<script defer>`),
  then an inline `<script>` with the page's Alpine components. They don't use
  the loader at all.
- **Loader-based pages** (`show-repo/show-repo.html`,
  `show-repo/demo-viewer.html`, `scratch/demo-spacex.html`,
  `lib/kits/demos/{persistence,messaging,io}.html`) —
  use `gh-api.js` (with `gh-fetch.js` / `gh-store.js` / `gh-auth.js` loaded
  as augmentations) + `alpine-bundle.js` to load reusable components off the
  repo at runtime.

This doc is about the second tier: the contract a file must honor to be
loadable this way, the timing invariants the boot sequence depends on, and —
because that same contract is what lets a page be frozen into an offline
**build** — how load and build are two readings of one set of rules (see
[Load and build are one contract](#load-and-build-are-one-contract)). The
build/bake tooling and the render harness that exercises all of this live
under [`tools/`](../tools/README.md).

## The loader-based page pattern, annotated

Every loader-based page's `<head>` looks like this, with minor variation:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4,npm/@phosphor-icons/web"></script>
<link href=".../daisyui@5/themes.css,npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" />
<script type="module">
  // ?use=<branch|tag|sha> picks which ref the bundle loads from; defaults to main.
  // gh-api.js auto-bootstraps from the URL it was imported by (parses owner/repo/ref
  // out of import.meta.url, sets window.gh, loads gh-auth.js), so the page just
  // chains gh.load() calls below.
  const ref = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('use') || 'main';
  await import(`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mehrlander/web-tools@${ref}/lib/gh-api.js`);

  await gh.load('gh-fetch.js');                   // 0) augment GH with read methods (resolved under lib/)
  // await gh.load('gh-store.js');                //    optional: write methods

  await gh.load('alpineComponents/repo.js');      // 1) register Alpine.data('repo', ...)
  await gh.load('alpineComponents/navigator.js'); // 2) register Alpine.data('navigator', ...)
  await gh.load('alpineComponents/viewer.js');    // 3) register Alpine.data('viewer', ...)
  await gh.load('alpine-bundle.js');              // 4) register magics + boot Alpine
</script>
```

The page body then has `<body x-data="app()" x-init="init()">` and the
components each use `x-data="repo()"`, `x-data="navigator()"`,
`x-data="viewer()"`.

The `?use=` convention is opt-in per page. Pages that adopt it gain a runtime
ref-pinning hatch: append `?use=<branch-or-sha>` to the URL and every file
loaded after `gh-api.js` comes from that ref instead of main. The HTML itself
still comes from GitHub Pages on main; only the runtime-loaded files are
ref-pinned. Older pages that hard-code the bundle URL without `@<ref>` are
unaffected; the auto-bootstrap inside `lib/gh-api.js` only triggers when the
import URL carries an `@<ref>` segment and points at `lib/gh-api.js`. That
same match sets the loader's `loadBase` to `lib/`, so every later
`gh.load('kits/x.js')` resolves under `lib/`.

### What each piece contributes

- `lib/gh-api.js` — ESM default export, `class GH`. Imported via
  `<script type="module">`, not `gh.load` (bootstrap: it *is* the loader).
  Minimal cached root: provides `req / get / parseUrl / ago / load` and the
  request/cache plumbing. Read methods (`ls / repos / history / …`) live in
  `gh-fetch.js`; write methods live in `gh-store.js`; token resolution
  lives in `gh-auth.js`. All three are loaded via `gh.load(...)` and patch
  `GH.prototype` in place. **Auto-bootstrap:** when imported from a
  `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<owner>/<repo>@<ref>/lib/gh-api.js` URL, the file parses
  owner/repo/ref out of `import.meta.url`, instantiates `window.gh`, sets
  `window.__bundleRef`, sets `loadBase` to `lib/`, and chains in `gh-auth.js`.
  Pages can then skip
  `new GH(...)` and `gh.load('gh-auth.js')` boilerplate by reading `?use=`
  from the page URL and embedding it in the bundle's import URL.
- `gh-auth.js` — optional augmentation. Patches the `headers` getter so
  that any request with a missing or sentinel-bearing token (`🎟️GitHubToken`)
  lazily resolves from `localStorage.ghToken`. Lets a page do
  `new GH({ repo })` without plumbing tokens through the constructor while
  still preserving the iOS-Shortcut data-URL substitution path. Also
  patches `req` so a 401/403 takes over the page with a token-entry form
  (idempotent), and installs a window `unhandledrejection` handler that
  renders a generic "Boot failed" UI for other rejections that fire while
  `document.readyState === 'loading'` (the heuristic for "boot in
  progress"). Pages whose boot doesn't fit the module-top-level-await
  model can call `window.ghAuth.bootDone()` at the end of their chain to
  suppress the handler. Also exposes
  `window.ghAuth.{resolve,save,clear,prompt,bootDone}` for explicit use.
  Loaded automatically by `gh-api.js`'s `@<ref>` auto-bootstrap; pages
  that import `gh-api.js` without `@<ref>` must `await gh.load('gh-auth.js')`
  themselves.
- `alpine-bundle.js` — IIFE. Inside an `alpine:init` handler it creates
  `Alpine.store('browser')`, `Alpine.store('toasts')`, and magics `$clip`,
  `$paste`, `$toast`. After registering the listener it injects two
  `<script>` tags to load the Alpine collapse plugin, then Alpine itself —
  which fires `alpine:init`, runs all registered handlers, then initializes
  the DOM.
- `alpineComponents/*.js` — each calls `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', …)`
  with `Alpine.data('name', fn)` inside. They reach across to other
  components via `Alpine.store('browser')` and via per-element back-pointers
  (`this.$root.__navigator = this`).
- The view registry (Tabulator/Prism/Marked render modes) lives inside
  `alpineComponents/viewer.js` as a module-private constant.
  Pages don't load it separately.

## The load mechanism

`GH.prototype.load`, from `gh-api.js`, is deliberately almost nothing:

```js
const text = (await this.get(this.loadBase + path)).text;   // fetch the file
const scopedGh = new Proxy(this, { /* stamps `by:` on nested gh.load */ });
await new Function('gh', text)(scopedGh);                    // run it as-is
```

The file is fetched and run **verbatim — no source rewriting.** (`read()`,
the data twin, is identical except it returns the file's value instead of
discarding it.) That "as-is" is the whole contract, and it's worth stating
plainly because the docs used to describe the opposite: `load()` *once*
stripped `export` / `export default` out of the source and auto-`return`ed
the first top-level `class`/`function` it found. Both are gone. The strip was
removed (commit `451f963`) because rewriting every file silently corrupted
any that merely *carried* the word `export` in a string or comment —
`kits/build.js`, which emits an `export default` in its output template, was
the file that exposed it.

The framing the strip obscured, and the one to keep: **we don't author
modules.** A loaded file is a plain script body, not an ES module that the
loader de-modularizes. It runs inside `new Function('gh', text)(...)`, so:

1. **No `import` / `export`, ever.** Not "stripped" — *invalid*. Either
   keyword inside a `new Function` body throws `SyntaxError` at load. A file
   that needs a library reaches a global (a `<script>` already on the page)
   or uses `await import(...)`, which is an ordinary expression and is fine.
2. **`gh` is in scope.** The loader injects the instance as the function's
   one argument, so a loaded file calls `gh.load(...)` / `gh.get(...)`
   directly — the injected `gh` is a proxy that records which file each
   nested load came from (`by:` attribution). `window.gh` works too.
3. **`load()` discards the return value; it runs files for their side
   effects.** A loaded file makes itself available by *doing* something:
   `window.X = …`, `Alpine.data('name', …)` inside an `alpine:init` listener,
   or patching `GH.prototype` (as `gh-fetch.js` / `gh-store.js` do). Top-level
   `const`/`let` are local to the run and vanish; there is no auto-`return`
   of a named declaration anymore.
4. **`read()` is the value-returning twin.** When a file's job is to
   *produce* a value rather than register a side effect, it ends with a
   top-level `return X;` and the caller uses `gh.read(path)` (or, for a local
   sibling file on `file://`, deposits on `document.currentScript.value`).
   That's the data path, distinct from code loading.

The consequence for outside code: anything genuinely modular — Alp's
`utils/kits/` with `import { brotli } from './brotli.js'`, say — **cannot go
through `gh.load()`**. It's ESM; load it with native `import()` instead.

## The timing invariants, stated explicitly

These hold in the current loader-based pages and must not be broken by
anything we add:

1. **`gh-api.js` is imported first**, via native `import()`. Nothing else
   has dependencies. `gh-fetch.js` / `gh-store.js` are then loaded through
   `gh.load(...)`; they require `window.GH` to already exist and will throw
   if pulled directly from a `<script type="module">`.
2. **Any `alpine:init` handler must be registered before Alpine boots.**
   Concretely: every `gh.load('alpineComponents/*.js')` call must happen
   *before* `gh.load('alpine-bundle.js')`. Alpine doesn't start until
   alpine-bundle injects the Alpine `<script>` tag, so the serial `await`s
   in the module script guarantee this.
3. **`alpine-bundle.js` is the boot signal.** It registers the `browser`
   and `toasts` stores on `alpine:init`, then appends Alpine's script tag.
   Whenever Alpine loads, its `alpine:init` fires, our handlers run, stores
   exist, and only then does Alpine walk the DOM and call `init()` on each
   `x-data` component. By that point `Alpine.store('browser')` is defined.
4. **`x-init="init()"` on the body still races the module script.** That's
   why `show-repo/show-repo.html`'s `app.init()` opens with
   `while(!window.GH) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 50));`.
   Alpine can reach `init()` before the module script's final
   `gh.load(...)` resolves, because the two tasks (module script vs.
   Alpine boot) aren't coordinated.
5. **Component-to-component handles rely on element back-pointers.**
   `init() { this.$root.__navigator = this }` in `navigator.js`, and other
   pages do `while(!navEl.__navigator) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 50));`
   to wait for it. This is the current idiom for "have I mounted yet?".
6. **Token sentinel `🎟️GitHubToken`.** Both `gh-api.js` (in `headers`) and
   pages look for that exact string and replace it (or fall back to
   `localStorage.ghToken`). Anything we add that touches tokens must use
   the same sentinel.
7. **Boot failures are handled centrally by `gh-auth.js`.** Loader-based
   pages no longer wrap their module script in `try { ... } catch { ... }`.
   The boot chain is just a sequence of `await` calls. Failures propagate
   as unhandled rejections; gh-auth.js's `unhandledrejection` handler
   renders either the 401/403 token-entry form (via the `req` patch) or a
   generic "Boot failed" UI (gated on `document.readyState === 'loading'`).
   Module top-level await keeps readyState at `'loading'` until the chain
   settles, so the gate cleanly distinguishes boot-time rejections from
   later ones (e.g., from a click handler). Pages whose boot lives in a
   classic-script IIFE — where readyState transitions before the IIFE
   awaits resolve — should either convert to `<script type="module">` or
   call `window.ghAuth.bootDone()` at the end of their chain to opt into
   "boot is over, stop showing boot UI" semantics.

## What breaks the pattern

A short list of footguns to avoid when adding new files:

- **Adding `import` / `export` to a file loaded via `gh.load()`.** Both are
  invalid inside the loader's `new Function` body and throw at load — they
  are *not* stripped (that rewriting was removed; see "The load mechanism").
  Reach a global or use `await import(...)` instead.
- **Expecting `gh.load()` to hand back a value.** It doesn't — it runs the
  file for side effects and discards the result. Expose via `window.X`,
  `Alpine.data(...)`, or a `GH.prototype` patch; if you genuinely need a
  returned value, that's `read()`, not `load()`.
- **Computing a `gh.load(...)` path at runtime** (`gh.load(name)` or a
  template literal). It loads fine, but the static build walker only sees
  string-literal arguments, so a computed path is invisible to the build and
  won't be cached — the offline page then silently falls back to the network
  for it. Keep load paths literal; see [Load and build](#load-and-build-are-one-contract).
- **Registering `alpine:init` handlers after `alpine-bundle.js` loads.**
  Race depends on Alpine's CDN speed; intermittent. The rule is: all
  component files go before alpine-bundle.
- **Declaring top-level `const X = …` and expecting it to be visible
  elsewhere.** It's local to the eval'd function body and vanishes. Assign
  to `window.X`, or register a side effect.
- **Forgetting the `🎟️GitHubToken` sentinel.** Any new file that wants a
  token should look for that exact sentinel and fall back via
  `try { localStorage.getItem('ghToken') } catch {}` to stay data-URL-safe.
- **Relying on `Alpine.store('…')` at file top level.** Stores only exist
  after `alpine-bundle.js`'s `alpine:init` listener runs. Access them inside
  `init()` / methods / getters, not at the top level of the file.

## Load and build are one contract

The same rules that make a file *loadable* also make a page *buildable* into a
single offline artifact — because the build is the loader, not a separate
pipeline. `tools/build/build.mjs` (and the in-browser FAB export) emit the
real `gh-api.js` with exactly one thing overridden: `GH.prototype.get` reads
from an inlined `path → source` cache instead of the network. Everything
above still applies verbatim — same `new Function('gh', text)`, same
side-effect convention, same timing — only the *origin of the bytes* changes.

So the contract has two readings:

- **Load** (runtime, the dev loop): own code is fetched per-file through the
  contents API, freshest-wins, ref-pinnable with `?use=<ref>`. Edit a file in
  `lib/`, reload, see it. This is what the rest of this doc describes.
- **Build** (delivery): the reachable set of own-code files is frozen into
  `dist/<page>.js`, which a page adopts by pointing its `gh-api.js` import at
  the local build instead of jsDelivr. `bake` goes one further and inlines
  that into the page's HTML, so the page opens with zero own-code network. The
  build still honors `?use=<ref>` (an explicit ref falls through to the
  network), so a built page can be re-pinned for review.

A file that honors the contract is buildable for free — that's the *payoff*
of the discipline, not just its cost. Two consequences follow directly from
the mechanism:

- **Dependency edges must be statically discoverable.** The build's graph
  walker finds what to cache by scanning source for *string-literal*
  `gh.load('…')` / `_selfLoad('…')` arguments. A path computed at runtime
  loads but is invisible to the build, so it won't be cached and the offline
  page falls back to the network for it (the footgun above). Keep load paths
  literal.
- **`gh.load`-style vs. native ESM also decides build-portability.** A
  `gh.load`-loaded file rides into the build automatically; a file pulled in
  with native `import()` is opaque to the build the same way a third-party CDN
  lib is — it stays on the network. So the ESM-vs-`gh.load` choice in the
  options below is *also* a choice about whether the file can ship inside an
  offline build.

The operational side — the four verbs `load → build → bake → export`, the
commands, and the byte-identical `verify-build` guarantee — lives in
[`tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md).

## Options for adding new capability

Roughly in order of "how much do we disturb the current pattern".

### Option A — drop files alongside `alpine-bundle.js` and load them the same way

Best for: more Alpine components (like compression UIs), additional
magics/stores, anything that extends `Alpine.data`/`Alpine.store`.

Rules:
- Use the `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () => { Alpine.data(…) })`
  idiom.
- No ES imports. If the code needs a library, either (a) add a plain
  `<script src=…>` to the CDN combine in the page, or (b) `await import(...)`
  dynamically inside the component's methods.
- Load it before `alpine-bundle.js` in the page's module script.

Cost: adds one line per page; fine for a handful of additions.

### Option B — extend `gh-api.js` (or its augmentations)

Best for: things every loader-based page wants (retry/backoff for rate
limits, a batch loader, a tiny pub-sub, a token-picker UI helper, a
`persist(key, data)` helper that saves to the user's home repo the way
`show-repo/show-repo.html` currently does).

Rules:
- `gh-api.js` is the ESM root (default export `class GH`); `gh-fetch.js`
  and `gh-store.js` are augmentations loaded via `gh.load(...)` that patch
  `GH.prototype`. Adding methods to either is cheap.
- Put read-only / cached helpers in `gh-fetch.js`; put mutation helpers in
  `gh-store.js`; only put true plumbing (request, cache, parseUrl, load)
  in `gh-api.js`.
- Keep all three import-only / side-effect-free at module level. The page
  decides when to instantiate and which augmentations to load.
- Anything that reaches into Alpine (stores, magics) does *not* belong
  here — that's alpine-bundle's job.

Cost: every loader-based page gets it free. Risk: it becomes a kitchen sink.
Good rule of thumb: only add a method if at least two pages would use it.

### Option C — add a third loader file

Best for: a concern that is not "GitHub access" and not "Alpine init" —
e.g., a component loader convention, a compression kit, a persistent
storage helper.

Rules:
- Decide up front whether it's ESM (loaded via native `import()`) or
  `gh.load`-compatible (plain script). Don't try to be both.
- ESM is better for anything with internal imports or multiple exports.
  Consumers pay one extra `await import(…)` in the module script.
- Plain-script form is only better if the file registers side effects
  against a global Alpine (which is what `alpineComponents/*.js` already
  does).
- Name it clearly: `foo-kit.js` for ESM with exports, `foo-register.js`
  for side-effect-only scripts meant for `gh.load`, or similar.

Current precedent: `gh-api.js` is native ESM. `gh-fetch.js` and
`gh-store.js` are plain-script augmentations loaded via `gh.load` that
mutate `GH.prototype`. `alpineComponents/*.js` are plain-script
side-effect files loaded via `gh.load`. Pick the style deliberately;
ESM and `gh.load`-style files can't be interchanged freely because of
the `new Function()` constraint.

### Option D — step outside the pattern for one-off pages

Best for: pages that don't need repo browsing at all (e.g., the simple
`pages/stories/bookmarklets-story.html` or `table-compress.html`).

Rules:
- Just use CDN Alpine + inline components, like the existing simple pages.
- Keep any "kit" files as plain ESM modules under a dedicated folder and
  `import` them directly in a `<script type="module">` block. No `gh.load`,
  no alpine-bundle.

Cost: more duplication across pages. Benefit: maximum independence and
zero bootstrap machinery.

## Concrete framing for "pulling in Alp-style capability"

Mapping the options to what Alp offered:

- **Compression helpers (`brotli.js`, `gzip.js`, `acorn.js`, `text.js`)** —
  these are ESM with internal imports. They are **Option C, ESM flavor**:
  drop them under `compression/` and `import` them directly from pages.
  They can't go through `gh.load`. They also don't need to, because they
  don't touch Alpine.

- **Tabulator helpers (`kits/tb.js` — `downloadJson`, `downloadZip`)** —
  same thing, ESM helpers. Either **Option C** or inline into
  `alpineComponents/viewer.js` since that's where Tabulator
  is used today.

- **Dexie key-value wrapper (`kits/dexie.js`)** — ESM, fits **Option C**.
  Useful enough to live in its own `storage.js` or similar and be imported
  by any page that wants persistence beyond localStorage.

- **Alpine-data components (Alp's `alp-tb`, `alp-jse`, `inspector`)** —
  these would be **Option A**-shaped if rewritten as
  `Alpine.data('jse', () => …)` registrations. But they currently depend
  on Alp's path/save/load/ping runtime — either we port that runtime (big)
  or rewrite each component against our own store. Probably skip unless
  we commit to a storage model.

- **Path/save/load/ping model (`core.js`)** — if we ever want it, it's a
  new loader file. **Option C, plain-script flavor, or ESM** — and
  the choice matters: if we want individual components (like an updated
  `alpineComponents/foo.js`) to call `save()`/`load()`, the runtime needs
  to be attached to globals before alpine-bundle loads. ESM with dynamic
  import + `window.assign` is fine; plain-script loaded ahead of
  alpine-bundle is fine too.

## Quick checklist for "can I load this file through gh.load?"

- [ ] Any `import` / `export` at the top? → **Remove them — they throw at
      load. Reach a global or use `await import(...)`.**
- [ ] Does it need to produce a value for the caller? → **That's `read()`,
      not `load()`. End the file with `return X;` and call `gh.read(path)`.**
- [ ] Side-effect file (component / kit / augmentation)? → **Expose via
      `window.X`, `Alpine.data(...)`, or a `GH.prototype` patch — `load()`
      ignores the return value.**
- [ ] Are its `gh.load(...)` paths string literals? → **Keep them literal so
      the build can see them; a computed path won't be cached offline.**
- [ ] Does it use `Alpine.store(...)` / `Alpine.data(...)`? → **Register them
      inside `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', …)` and load the file
      before `alpine-bundle.js`.**
- [ ] Does it need a token? → **Use the `🎟️GitHubToken` sentinel with the
      `localStorage.ghToken` fallback, data-URL-safe.**

If a file is genuinely modular (real `import`/`export`), use a native
`import()` instead of `gh.load()` for it. Mixing is fine: a page can do

```js
import GH from '.../lib/gh-api.js';
const { text } = await import('.../compression/text.js');
const gh = new GH({ token, repo });
await gh.load('gh-fetch.js');
await gh.load('alpineComponents/foo.js');
await gh.load('alpine-bundle.js');
```

and everything orders correctly as long as each `await` completes before
the next starts.
