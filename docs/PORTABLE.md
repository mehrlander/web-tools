# Portable set (the to-go bag)

The docs and scripts in `mehrlander/web-tools` that are written to be used **from
any repo**, not just this one. If you want this repo's working conventions, its
recipe for building with a favorite front-end stack and testing it headless, or
its tracker board generator, without adopting the whole library, this is the menu.

The **`portable` plugin** is the front door: one install brings the whole bag
(see [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md)). This file is the catalog behind it, the
*what* to the plugin's *how*, and it lists the pieces that ride along outside the
plugin (reference docs, scripts, the tracker) to fetch when you use them. The
raw-URL fetch recipes below remain the no-install fallback for environments where
plugins are unavailable.

The machine-readable index of this catalog is [`docs/portable.json`](portable.json):
show-repo's **Portable view** renders the set from it (each piece openable in
the shell's viewer) beside a live per-repo adoption matrix, and
`tools/test/portable-manifest.test.mjs` holds the manifest and this file's
tables consistent so neither drifts.

## How to adopt

Install the `portable` plugin once. One-off, in any session:

```
/plugin marketplace add mehrlander/web-tools
/plugin install portable@web-tools
```

Standing, for a repo (the committed form; cloud sessions install it at session
start): add the `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins` block to
`.claude/settings.json`, shown in [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md).

**What one install brings (the bag):**

| Piece | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `/portable:web-tools` | loads the working conventions live (surfacing primitives + the guide-PR/merge-guide course) |
| `/portable:caption` | the surfacing caption, and the guide-PR body sync |
| `/portable:load-skill` | fetch any skill from the [library](../skills/) on demand |
| `/portable:show-repo` | browse any repo and move files across repos |
| `/portable:tree` | render a linked file tree of the repo, table-first for mobile |
| `/portable:tasks` | operate the cross-session project tracker (propose, file, claim, close, regenerate the board), and the filing rules that keep the backlog honest |
| `/portable:repo-review` | read the repo's own state and report what stands out, at three depths (light, deep, sweep) |
| `/portable:in-flight` | check whether a branch, PR, or task is already working on something, and reconcile stale tracker claims |
| `/portable:markers` | what is frozen, stale, or wrong: mark a claim, declare a path in `.paths.json`, inventory both, check that they agree |
| `/portable:sandbox-traps` | the web sandbox's enumerable failures, each of which impersonates a worse one: the test that tells them apart, and the rule. Triggers on the symptom rather than waiting to be asked, since a session hits these while concluding, not while stuck |
| `/portable:content-registry` | the epistemic content registry: classify a repo's artifacts (supplied, mechanical, human-, model-, or hybrid-authored) and their corpus membership in a curated `data/design/content.csv`; scaffold, verify, extract. Bundles `registry.py` the way `tasks` bundles its board generator |
| `/portable:concept-index` | build a repo's declared vocabulary and check a piece of writing against it: which repo files it names without a link, and which terms of art it uses as though the reader already knows them |
| `/portable:drop-link` | mint a link that opens GitHub's new-file form on the working branch with the filename prefilled, so long content lands on the branch without riding through chat context |
| `/portable:edit-review` | hand over an edited file for second-opinion review: stage its before and after into show-repo's Diff lens, bespoke review prompts riding the link |
| `/portable:file-retrieval` | retrieve files from a configured corpus through a fixed-behavior tool (ranked snippet search, whole-document reads), so retrieval reads the same every run |
| the session recorder | a `Stop` hook that records the session where a checkout declares a `"sessions"` store, and does nothing at all where none does |
| the session dispatcher | a `SessionStart` hook that runs every checkout's own `.claude/hooks/session-*.sh`, in every session, whatever the project root is |

That is the whole day-to-day set. Everything above the last two rows is invoked;
those two are not. **They are the pieces that run on their own**, which is why
they ship in the plugin rather than being installed per repo: the per-container
settings file they would otherwise live in is provisioned fresh each session, so
a hand-installed copy works for exactly one session and then vanishes.

The recorder is inert without a store, costing one `grep` before it exits, and
it holds no knowledge of the record format. Mechanism, measurements, and the
declaration it looks for:
[environment/extending.md](environment/extending.md#stop-the-session-recorder).

### The session dispatcher

The harness has no glob for session-start scripts. `npm test` finds its whole
suite from `tools/test/**/*.test.mjs`, and git finds its hooks from a folder
once `core.hooksPath` is set, but a Claude Code hook has to be named
individually in `.claude/settings.json`, and that file is read **only when the
session's project root is that repo**. A session spanning several checkouts has
its root above all of them, so none of their session hooks fire, and nothing
reports it. Measured 2026-07-31: a session rooted at `/home/user` ran none of
the four `SessionStart` hooks a checkout below it had registered.

The dispatcher supplies the missing glob at the one layer that can. The plugin
registers it once, at user scope, for every session; discovery is then by
filename, the same contract the test suite already uses:

```
.claude/hooks/session-*.sh   ->  runs at session start
anything else in that folder ->  ignored
```

So a repo adopts it by **naming a file**, with nothing declared anywhere, and
opts a script out the same way, by calling it something else. web-tools' own
`session-start.sh` is picked up and its `build-on-commit.sh` is not, exactly as
`tools/test/bootstrap.mjs` stays out of `node --test`. The name is the whole
declaration, which is why the executable bit is not also required: a lost mode
bit should not quietly turn a script off.

Each script runs with its own checkout as both cwd and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, so
a script already written for `.claude/settings.json` moves under the dispatcher
unchanged. Scripts run in parallel under a per-script timeout, so the wall clock
is the slowest one rather than the sum, and a script that hangs is stopped and
named instead of holding the session open. The budget defaults to 120s
(`WEB_TOOLS_SESSION_BUDGET` overrides it), matching the longest internal timeout
the existing scripts already set for themselves, so adopting the dispatcher does
not change what any repo was already willing to wait for.

**Adopting it is a migration, not an addition.** The dispatcher replaces the
declaration mechanism rather than sitting beside it, so a repo renames its
scripts to `session-*.sh` **and drops the `SessionStart` block from its own
`.claude/settings.json`**. Keeping both means each script runs twice whenever
that repo is the project root. Parallel execution is the other thing a migration
has to look at: entries that were an ordered list in `settings.json` no longer
have an order, so a script depending on an earlier one has to do that work
itself. home's `session-news-fetch.sh` sets `core.hooksPath` rather than
assuming `session-git-config.sh` won the race.

An inline command has no filename, so it cannot be discovered and needs a file
of its own. That is not a technicality: home's `SessionStart` carried a bare
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, and it was the entry whose silent absence
actually cost something, leaving the repo's pre-commit lint and size guard off
for any session rooted above it.

Both mistakes are reported rather than left silent. When a checkout's
`.claude/settings.json` still declares `SessionStart`, the dispatcher says so at
session start, naming which case it is: no `session-*.sh` to discover (so
nothing of that repo's ran) or scripts present alongside the declaration (so they
double-run at that root). The check keys on the repo's own `SessionStart`
declaration, not on an empty hooks folder, because a repo whose only hook is
`PreToolUse` is correct rather than misconfigured.

The dispatcher bounds what a script costs; it does not police it, any more than
`node --test` polices a slow test. **Keeping session start cheap is the script's
job**, and the convention is: gate on file reads, and do expensive work only
when the gate says it is due. A repo whose script genuinely needs minutes should
background it rather than hold the session open.

One caveat while adopting: a repo that also registers the same script in its own
`.claude/settings.json` will run it twice in a session rooted at that repo.
Delete the `settings.json` entry once the dispatcher covers it, keeping one only
where a repo disables the plugin and so has no dispatcher at all.

Every dispatched script gets **`$WEB_TOOLS_HOOKS`**, the directory the plugin's
own hooks live in, so a repo can call something the plugin ships without knowing
where the cache put it or which commit it is pinned at. There is one such script
today, and it is the reason the variable exists.

### Injecting the conventions, with no fetch

The plugin carries the hub's own `CONVENTIONS.md` and `SURFACING.md`, beside the
loader skill that names them, and ships
[`inject-conventions.sh`](../.claude/skills/hooks/inject-conventions.sh) to emit
them into session context. A repo opts in with one line:

```bash
# .claude/hooks/session-conventions.sh
exec bash "$WEB_TOOLS_HOOKS/inject-conventions.sh"
```

That is the whole adoption. Two file reads, no network, no `curl`, no `jq`, and
no interpreter that can be missing, which retires the sharp edge the fetch-based
variant below has to warn about. Freshness rides `claude plugin update`, the
mechanism that already repeats every container; a fetch per session bought
nothing an update does not, at the cost of a round trip at every start.

It is **not** registered as a hook in its own right, and that is the point of
routing it through the dispatcher. Injection puts the full conventions into
every session unconditionally, which is right for a repo whose `CLAUDE.md`
deliberately does not restate them and wrong for a repo that just wants the
skills. Naming a file is the opt-in; deleting it is the opt-out.

The vendored copies are a derived artifact, so they have the two owners this
repo gives every derived artifact: `.claude/hooks/build-on-commit.sh` refreshes
and stages them in the same commit that touches `docs/`, and
[`tools/test/artifacts-lockstep.test.mjs`](../tools/test/artifacts-lockstep.test.mjs)
fails if they fall behind, for the sessions where the hook never fires. A stale
copy is the failure worth guarding: it injects confidently and governs the
session with last month's rules.

One script rides inside the plugin: the board
generator (`build-board.py`) is bundled with the `tasks` skill, so `/tasks`
regenerates a board with nothing to fetch. The reference docs and the other
scripts below are not in the plugin: they are fetched by raw URL when a task
needs them (the skills that use a script fetch it themselves). The `tasks` skill ships in the
bag, but the tracker it operates (the `docs/TRACKER.md` schema, the task files,
`board.md`) stays per-repo and is fetched or bootstrapped when a repo adopts it. Everything is
reachable directly from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehrlander/web-tools/main/<path>` (the repo is
public and that host is on the Claude Code web allowlist), which is also the
no-plugin fallback for the whole bag.

## The repo's config file: `.web-tools.json`

A repo's web-tools config lives in one file, root **`.web-tools.json`**, parsed as
data and never executed. It is optional: a repo with none is simply unconfigured.
Top-level fields, not namespaced by consumer, so any web-tools page can read them:

| Field | Read by | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| `icon` | show-repo | Phosphor class a repo self-declares for its quick-link button (the row's icon actually comes from the registry, below) |
| `quickLinks` | show-repo | registry repo only: the curated header quick-link list `[{repo, icon}]`, read from the private registry repo when the viewer has a token |
| `landing` | show-repo | path to the repo's own landing page (rendered live via toss-render `#gh=`) |
| `scope` | show-repo (Map) | the repo's own account of what it holds and why: inline prose, or a repo path ending in `.md` (a file pointer). The repo owns the story; the Map view stacks the per-repo statements rather than keeping a central list |
| `pins` | show-repo | folders/files surfaced in the sidebar Pinned block |
| `checks` | show-repo | declared staleness checks, evaluated on sight and surfaced only when failing: in a repo's sidebar **Needs attention** block, and as badges on its estate card. Five kinds, each answerable from the API alone; nothing here runs code, so anything needing execution stays in a test suite |
| `stage` | show-repo | `{ files, targets }`: a durable staged-files list and default transfer destinations |
| `conventions` | session-start nudge | `"optout"` marks a repo that has deliberately not adopted the conventions, so the nudge stops asking |
| `sessions` | the plugin's `Stop` hook | path to the directory holding this repo's session records and their `tools/`, which makes this repo the store the recorder writes to. Declaring it is what turns recording on; at most one checkout in a session should carry it |

Full field semantics for the show-repo fields are in [`docs/show-repo.md`](show-repo.md).
The file was formerly `.show-repo.json`; readers fall back to that name so an
unconverted repo keeps working. That fallback is a back-compat shim tagged
`SUNSET(2026-08-15)` (see Sunset markers below); it is removed once repos are
migrated, after which only `.web-tools.json` is read.

## Staying current on the fetch fallback: refresh at session start

The `portable` plugin auto-updates (it declares no `version`, so consumers track
the tip; see [MARKETPLACE.md](MARKETPLACE.md)), so a plugin install needs nothing
here. This section is for the raw-URL fetch fallback only.

The skill fetches `CONVENTIONS.md` live on every run, so the *conventions* never
go stale once the skill is **invoked**. The pieces that can drift are the loader
**skill file** itself (its fetch URL, fallbacks, description) and any portable
**scripts** a consumer runs. A consuming repo that wants these kept current can
re-fetch them each session with a single fail-soft `SessionStart` hook, instead
of re-running the installer by hand whenever anything changes. The hook is the
committed mechanism; the fetched artifacts are gitignored, so they're fresh every
session and never stale copies in the tree.

1. `.claude/hooks/web-tools-sync.sh` (`chmod +x`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -uo pipefail
BASE="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehrlander/web-tools/main"
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}"

fetch() {
  local url="$1" dest="$2"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$dest")" 2>/dev/null || return
  if curl -fsSL --max-time 10 "$url" -o "$dest.tmp" 2>/dev/null; then
    mv "$dest.tmp" "$dest" 2>/dev/null || rm -f "$dest.tmp"
  else
    rm -f "$dest.tmp" 2>/dev/null
  fi
}

# Skills
fetch "$BASE/.claude/skills/web-tools/SKILL.md" \
      "$ROOT/.claude/skills/web-tools/SKILL.md"
fetch "$BASE/.claude/skills/caption/SKILL.md" \
      "$ROOT/.claude/skills/caption/SKILL.md"
fetch "$BASE/.claude/skills/load-skill/SKILL.md" \
      "$ROOT/.claude/skills/load-skill/SKILL.md"

# Portable scripts (these ship in the plugin; a no-plugin repo fetches the
# same files by raw URL from their bundled locations)
fetch "$BASE/.claude/skills/tasks/build-board.py" \
      "$ROOT/.web-tools-scripts/build-board.py"
chmod +x "$ROOT/.web-tools-scripts/build-board.py" 2>/dev/null
fetch "$BASE/.claude/skills/markers/status.py" \
      "$ROOT/.web-tools-scripts/status.py"
chmod +x "$ROOT/.web-tools-scripts/status.py" 2>/dev/null

exit 0
```

2. Gitignore the fetched artifacts, so the hook (not a checked-in copy) is the source of truth:

```
.claude/skills/web-tools/
.claude/skills/caption/
.claude/skills/load-skill/
.web-tools-scripts/
```

3. Register it under `SessionStart` in `.claude/settings.json`, alongside any hook already there:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/web-tools-sync.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Why it holds: the hook is committed and the fetched artifacts are gitignored
(fresh each session, never stale copies in the tree); it's fail-soft (10s cap
per fetch, errors swallowed, always `exit 0`), so a hiccup or a web-tools outage
degrades to "no auto-loaded conventions this session," not a blocked start; and
it fetches over `raw.githubusercontent.com`, on the web allowlist (see "How to
adopt" above), so no auth. Keep it **synchronous** (the default) so it completes
before skill discovery and the freshly-fetched skill is live in the *same*
session, not the next one. To add a new portable script, add one `fetch` line.
This is a recipe for *consuming* repos; web-tools is the source and doesn't run
it on itself.

### Stronger variant: inject the conventions, don't just fetch them

> [!NOTE]

The hook above still leans on the always-on CLAUDE.md line to close the
fetch→invoke gap. A `SessionStart` hook can instead **emit the conventions
straight into context** via `additionalContext`, collapsing fetch and invoke into
one step and removing the dependency on the agent obeying any CLAUDE.md line: the
text is simply *there* at the start of every session, the same as if the skill
had run. Use this when you want the conventions unconditionally governing every
file-modifying session and don't mind paying their context cost up front.

This hook fetches the conventions themselves (not the skill file) and prints the
SessionStart `additionalContext` JSON the harness reads. The conventions are two
files now, `CONVENTIONS.md` (the hub) and `SURFACING.md` (the surfacing system),
so it fetches and concatenates both; fetching only the hub would inject a session
with no surfacing rules:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -uo pipefail
BASE="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehrlander/web-tools/main/docs"
BODY=""
for f in CONVENTIONS SURFACING; do
  PART="$(curl -fsSL --max-time 10 "$BASE/$f.md" 2>/dev/null)" || exit 0
  [ -n "$PART" ] || exit 0
  BODY="$BODY$PART"$'\n\n'
done
command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
printf '%s' "$BODY" | jq -Rs \
  '{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"SessionStart",additionalContext:.}}'
```

Register it under `SessionStart` exactly like the fetch hook (step 3 above). It's
fail-soft on the same principle: a failed fetch, an empty body, or a missing `jq`
each `exit 0` with no output, degrading to "no injected conventions this session"
rather than a blocked start. (No `jq`? Swap the last line for
`python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SessionStart","additionalContext":sys.stdin.read()}}))'`.)

> [!WARNING]
> That fail-soft posture has a sharp edge worth naming, because it's the same
> bug this whole doc is about. If a host has **neither** `jq` nor `python3`, the
> `command -v … || exit 0` guard makes the hook degrade *silently* to
> no-injection: the very fetch-without-invoke no-op the variant exists to
> prevent, now wearing a different hat. That's the right default for a

> replace the guard with a branch that warns to stderr (and/or emits an
> `additionalContext` note saying "conventions failed to load"), so a
> misconfigured host fails noisily instead of quietly governing nothing.

Trade-offs versus the skill-fetch hook: this injects the conventions into **every**
session unconditionally (always-on context cost, no model judgement), it loads
`CONVENTIONS.md` raw rather than through the skill's à-la-carte "apply" framing,
and it doesn't keep the loader **skill** itself installed (so `/web-tools`
and the model-invocation path won't exist unless you also run the installer). The
two are complementary, not exclusive: a repo can run the skill-fetch hook *and*
this injector, or pick whichever matches how reliably it needs the conventions
present.

## The set

Portability is per-item, not per-directory. Most of `tools/` is web-tools-specific
machinery; most of `docs/` is portable. The tables below list what travels.

### Docs

| Doc | What it's for | How you use it |
|---|---|---|
| [`.claude/skills/web-tools/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/web-tools/SKILL.md) | the loader: pulls the conventions into any session, and links here for the rest | **install** (copy in, once) |
| [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) | the general-behavior **hub**: prose style, standing decisions, leave-it-nicer, make-work, and the session / repository / workstream scope vocabulary. Behavior that applies regardless of whether anything is being surfaced | fetched live by the skill |
| [`docs/SURFACING.md`](SURFACING.md) | the **surfacing system**, split out of CONVENTIONS.md: the universal **surfacing primitives** (the **surfacing caption**'s `[new]/[main]/[diff]` file links plus a 🥏 render line, reference-is-a-link, show-pixels, branch anchor, 🧭 guide pointer, session diff) plus the **surfacing course** (guide-PR/merge-guide lifecycle, wrap-up, handoff), which stays idle until you open a PR. Loaded with CONVENTIONS.md as one set | fetched live by the skill |
| [`.claude/skills/caption/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/caption/SKILL.md) | `/caption`: emit the surfacing caption (full, turn, bare, or recap size; recap wraps the full caption in a fixed-form session re-entry) for the current branch; also the sync engine for a guide PR body's managed region | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/load-skill/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/load-skill/SKILL.md) | `/load-skill`: fetch a named skill from the library at [`skills/`](../skills/) (or another declared source) and apply it in the current session; discovery via `skills/manifest.json`. Explicit signal only, never opportunistic | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/show-repo/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/show-repo/SKILL.md) | `/show-repo`: use the hosted show-repo shell to browse any repo, mint a 🗂️ `#stage=` fileset link, run a cross-repo transfer, or author a repo's `.web-tools.json`; loads [`docs/show-repo.md`](show-repo.md) | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/in-flight/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/in-flight/SKILL.md) | `/in-flight`: before starting work, report which branches carry commits the base branch lacks, which open PRs and [`docs/TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md) claims sit on them, and which claims have gone stale; `--paths` turns it into a collision check on the files about to change. Runs [`.claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py`](../.claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py) | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/markers/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/markers/SKILL.md) | `/markers`: the status system from [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md#status-frozen-stale-wrong). Mark a claim `Frozen`/`Stale`/`Wrong` in prose, declare a path frozen in a cascading `.paths.json`, inventory both across a repo, and check that arrow targets resolve and frozen files say so where they are read. Runs [`.claude/skills/markers/status.py`](../.claude/skills/markers/status.py) | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/tasks/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/tasks/SKILL.md) | `/tasks`: operate the project tracker (propose and file, claim, update, close a task; regenerate `board.md`) per the [`docs/TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md) schema and the commit-to-`main` rule. Owns the **filing rules**: the bar, the propose-first gate, and the rule against fragmenting one outcome across several tasks | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/repo-review/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/repo-review/SKILL.md) | `/repo-review`: read a repo's own state and report what stands out, at one of three depths (light everyday read, deep on-demand audit, parallel sweep fan-out). Probes before impressions; every depth ends in a written report rather than a pile of tracker tasks. Probes, layers, lenses, and destinations are declared per repo in its `CLAUDE.md` | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/tree/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/tree/SKILL.md) | `/tree`: render a repo or subtree as a linked markdown table (code-span box art or braille indent, filetype icons, optional gloss); generated by [`scripts/build-tree.py`](../scripts/build-tree.py) | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/sandbox-traps/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/sandbox-traps/SKILL.md) | `/sandbox-traps`: the web sandbox's enumerable failures, each of which impersonates a worse one, with the test that tells them apart and the rule. Triggers on the symptom rather than waiting to be asked | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/content-registry/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/content-registry/SKILL.md) | `/content-registry`: the epistemic content registry (`data/design/content.csv`): classify what each artifact is and which corpora it belongs to; scaffold, verify, extract. Bundles its `registry.py` | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/concept-index/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/concept-index/SKILL.md) | `/concept-index`: build a repo's declared vocabulary and check a piece of writing against it (unlinked file names, terms of art used as if already known). Runs its bundled `vocab.py` | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/drop-link/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/drop-link/SKILL.md) | `/drop-link`: mint a link opening GitHub's new-file form on the working branch with the filename prefilled, so long pasted content lands on the branch instead of riding through chat context | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/edit-review/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/edit-review/SKILL.md) | `/edit-review`: hand over an edited file for independent review by staging its before and after into show-repo's Diff lens, with bespoke review prompts encoded on the link | install or hook-fetch |
| [`.claude/skills/file-retrieval/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/file-retrieval/SKILL.md) | `/file-retrieval`: retrieve files from a configured corpus through a fixed-behavior tool (`corpus_search.py` for ranked snippets, `read_doc.py` for whole documents), one auditable command per retrieval | install or hook-fetch |
| [`docs/markdown-in-chat.md`](markdown-in-chat.md) | working visually with markdown in a **chat client** (mobile): why nested bullets balloon and tables beat them, which characters survive a table-cell trim, and the file-tree formats that fall out. Companion to [`docs/github/markdown.md`](github/markdown.md) (GitHub's static renderer) | fetch when relevant |
| [`skills/`](../skills/) | the skill **library**: 34 personal skills published as static resources (not registered anywhere); the default source `load-skill` pulls from | fetched per skill by load-skill |
| [`docs/TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md) | opt-in **project tracker**: cross-session work-tracking, one file per task under `tasks/` plus a generated `board.md`, the slow layer where the plan lives between sessions. Independent of the primitives and the course | fetch when adopting |
| [`docs/CONSTELLATION.md`](CONSTELLATION.md) | the portable **kernel** of the what-goes-where doctrine: the ephemeral-clone constraint, commit discipline, visibility forces repo boundaries, conventions pull from a public hub, bootstrapping equals staying-in-sync, and the repo owns its own scope. The theory show-repo's **Map** view applies; the full worked instance stays in the private `home` repo | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/HTML-STYLE.md`](HTML-STYLE.md) | the **house style for pages**: what to build, as against how. No stat cards, no explanatory prose on the page, browsing is a full-viewport takeover, type sized for reading. The composition rules the [daisy-alpine skill](../skills/daisy-alpine/SKILL.md) carries in short form and points here for in full | fetch when building a page |
| [`docs/headless-vendoring.md`](headless-vendoring.md) | build with Tailwind / daisyUI / Alpine / Phosphor and screenshot or test them **headless** in a sandbox that blocks their CDNs (the "Playwright won't load my libraries" problem) | fetch or copy; self-contained |
| [`docs/environment/`](environment/) | dated facts about the Claude Code **web sandbox** itself: network allowlist, what persists, the testing recipes. Sandbox-level, so they apply to a session in any repo | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/github/markdown.md`](github/markdown.md) | what GitHub's renderer does with markdown (Mermaid, math, alerts, sparklines): GitHub-level, not web-tools-level | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/github/mcp-server-routing.md`](github/mcp-server-routing.md) | when two GitHub MCP servers are connected at once, an unexpected approval prompt is often a routing artifact, not a permission wall: prefer/retry the stable `mcp__github__*` server before re-approving. Platform-level, applies in any repo | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/artifacts.md`](artifacts.md) | Claude Code **artifacts**: constraints, the bake-and-publish pipeline, and the 📦 marker's place beside ⭐/🥏 in the link-choice matrix. Platform-level, so it applies in any repo | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/show-repo.md`](show-repo.md) | the **show-repo** instrument: the hosted shell that browses any repo and moves files between repos (the stage, the 🗂️ `#stage=` link grammar, `gh-transfer`, and the `.web-tools.json` manifest). The reference the `show-repo` skill fetches | fetch when relevant |
| [`docs/envelopes/`](envelopes/) | the **content-envelope family**: JSON documents that carry a curated, annotated set of items for a reader to open, rendered by a web-tools page. [`README.md`](envelopes/README.md) frames the family; [`surface.md`](envelopes/surface.md) is the general `.surface` contract (v2, shared by the Surfacer desktop app and show-repo's estate view; profiles, first `branch-review/1`; v1→v2 migration); [`chat-results.md`](envelopes/chat-results.md) is the chat-search envelope; the stage (`docs/show-repo.md`) is the third carrier. The JSON Schemas in [`envelopes/schemas/`](envelopes/schemas/) are the validation source of truth | fetch when relevant |

### Scripts

Portable scripts live in `scripts/` at the repo root (the board generator
excepted: it ships bundled with the `tasks` skill so the plugin carries it):
fetchable by raw URL, runnable with no dependencies beyond python3 stdlib, and
parameterized by argv so one fetched copy serves many callers.

| Script | What it does | Interface |
|---|---|---|
| [`.claude/skills/tasks/build-board.py`](../.claude/skills/tasks/build-board.py) | regenerate a tracker's `board.md` from `tasks/*.md` frontmatter; bundled in the `portable` plugin, so `/tasks` runs it via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `python3 build-board.py <tasks_dir> <board_out>` |
| [`.claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py`](../.claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py) | sort a branch estate into live / merged / unrelated by ahead-count, then reconcile every `in-progress` tracker claim against the branch it names; bundled in the `portable` plugin, so `/in-flight` runs it via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `python3 in-flight.py <repo…> [--paths P…] [--prs F] [--fetch] [--json]` |
| [`scripts/build-merge-guide.py`](../scripts/build-merge-guide.py) | generate `docs/MERGE-GUIDE.md` from merged PR bodies (the guide region); non-destructive, `--refresh` to regenerate covered PRs | `python3 build-merge-guide.py [owner/repo] --out <file>` |
| [`scripts/link-survey.py`](../scripts/link-survey.py) | report markdown links that no longer resolve, in three classes: internal, cross-repo (a relative path escaping the repo root into a sibling checkout, which never resolves on github.com), and dead owner URLs at main in either the `github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob` or the `raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main` form. Owner URLs are also scanned BARE, inside fences and inline code, since a `curl` of a raw URL is a fetch target rather than an illustration and is where a rename does its quietest damage. A link into an absent checkout reports as *unverifiable*, never dead. `--check` gates the cross-repo classes for a verify suite; the internal class is never gated, since a target may have been retired on purpose | `python3 link-survey.py [ROOT] [--owner N] [--cross-repo] [--check]` |
| [`scripts/sunset-scan.py`](../scripts/sunset-scan.py) | report `SUNSET(YYYY-MM-DD)` markers now due for removal (see Sunset markers below); quiet unless something is due, `--all` lists upcoming, `--strict` exits non-zero when due | `python3 sunset-scan.py [--all] [--strict] [root]` |
| [`scripts/build-tree.py`](../scripts/build-tree.py) | render a repo tree as a linked markdown table for chat (code-span box art, braille indent, or plain ascii); tracked-only by default, gloss column left to fill by hand | `python3 build-tree.py <root> [--repo o/r] [--ref R] [--depth N] [--mode M] [--gloss]` |
| [`scripts/ocr-pdf.py`](../scripts/ocr-pdf.py) | OCR a scanned PDF and report how far to trust it: per-page word confidence from tesseract's TSV, and pages that already carry a text layer passed through untouched unless `--force`. Needs the system binaries `tesseract-ocr` and `poppler-utils`, absent from a fresh sandbox | `python3 ocr-pdf.py <pdf> [-o out.txt] [--report r.json] [--dpi N] [--lang L] [--force]` |

### Toolkits

A toolkit is larger than a script and carries dependencies, so it does not fit
the stdlib-only, one-file rule above. Clone or copy the directory rather than
fetching one raw URL, and run its bootstrap first.

| Toolkit | What it does | Interface |
|---|---|---|
| [`docstruct/`](../docstruct/) | extract structure from scanned documents by running several methods over each page and keeping all their answers, rather than picking one engine. Lossless page-image extraction, orientation correction decided by measurement instead of by the detector's own confidence, tesseract recognition, and a per-page record that holds competing extractions side by side. Needs `tesseract-ocr`, `poppler-utils`, PyMuPDF and Pillow, none present in a fresh sandbox | `./docstruct/bootstrap.sh` then `python3 docstruct/run.py <source> -o out/ [--sample f] [--workers N] [--psm N]` |

Fetching and running a script is executing hub code, a step beyond fetching and
reading a doc. That is why the hub must stay owned and trusted and the fetch stays
fail-soft: a consumer can audit the script at its raw URL, but there is no
signature or pinning beyond trusting the source repo.

### Sunset markers

Code kept only for backward compatibility (a legacy-name read fallback, a
migration shim) is tagged with a dated marker so it gets removed rather than
lingering:

```js
// SUNSET(2026-08-15): reads the legacy .show-repo.json name. Remove once
// consumer repos are migrated to .web-tools.json.
```

The marker is one greppable token, `SUNSET(YYYY-MM-DD)`, with the date it can
probably be removed. `scripts/sunset-scan.py` finds them: quiet until a marker's
date passes, then it names the file and line. Wire it warn-only into the commit
hook (as web-tools does) so a due marker resurfaces at commit time; run
`npm run sunset` (or `sunset-scan.py --all`) any time to list upcoming ones.
Generated output is skipped even when it is tracked (`dist/` and the rest of
`SKIP_DIRS`), since a marker in a build artifact is a copy of the one in its
source and reporting both doubles the count against a bundled line thousands of
characters wide.

### Not portable

Web-tools-specific machinery: `docs/loader.md`, `tools/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `dist/`.
And `docs/MERGE-GUIDE.md` travels only as a *format example*: it belongs to
CONVENTIONS.md's opt-in surfacing course, so a repo keeps one of its own only if
it adopts that layer.

## Pointing a session here

To send another Claude Code session to this set, [`docs/SHARE.md`](SHARE.md) is a
ready-to-paste message that hands over the fetch command itself (a session can't
always reach another repo by git or MCP scope, but a raw HTTP GET of these public
files works). It's the pointer *to* this set, not a member of it.
