# docs

<!-- GENERATED from docs/docs.csv by tools/build/docs-readme.mjs; do not hand-edit. -->

Reference docs that don't belong at the repo root. This index is generated
from [`docs.csv`](docs.csv), the documentation registry, which also renders
live in [the Web Tools app's Map view, Docs tab](https://mehrlander.github.io/web-tools/app/?view=map)
alongside the shared-claims table (statements that live in more than one
place, each with its one authoritative carrier and the check that holds each
copy, or the honest absence of one). A **record** preserves a moment and is
corrected by markers, never rewritten; a **measured** doc carries dated
observations and is corrected by re-probing; everything else is living and
must stay correct.

**Reach** (derived by `tools/build/docs-reach.mjs`, gated against the registry):
2 arrive in every session's context, 25 are named by CLAUDE.md,
6 by a skill, 27 by a page or component. The remaining 16 are
marked *(orphan)* below: nothing points at them except this index.

- [`registries.md`](registries.md) — the metadata model: targets, scopes, properties, declarations, assertions; ownership not overlay; the registry and catalog reduction
- [`repetitions.csv`](repetitions.csv) — where each registered statement is said again, how it relates, and what holds it
- [`routes-kinds.csv`](routes-kinds.csv) — the content kinds: what a subject is, what opens it, and what a note can aim at inside it
- [`routes-modes.csv`](routes-modes.csv) — the delivery modes toss-render accepts, and the trust posture each buys

- [`themes.json`](themes.json) *(measured)* — the duplication graph as committed data: every pair of markdown files sharing at least three ten-word windows, weighted, with the repeated passages themselves.
