# Inbound: how work reaches a session

[venues.md](venues.md) answers where work can *run*. This file answers the
question next to it, which had never been asked: how does work *reach* a
session, whether one is running or not. The two are easy to conflate and they
fail differently. A venue that cannot be reached is idle; an inbound channel
with no venue behind it is a message nobody reads.

**Measured 2026-08-20 and 2026-08-21.** Every claim here was tested rather than
reasoned about, on this file's own pull request and a private-repo probe beside
it. See "What was measured" below.

## The channels

| Channel | Who can send | Push or pull | Durable | Reachable by a non-Anthropic agent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chat prompt | the user | it *is* the session | no | no |
| **PR comment, subscribed** | anyone with repo write *except this session* | **push** | yes | **yes** |
| `SendMessage` between sessions | Claude sessions on the account | push | no | no |
| Routine, `send_later` | a schedule, or a session arming itself | push | the trigger is | no |
| errand, `errands/requests/` | a session, answered by a person in the browser | pull | yes | by token |
| `chron/dump/`, drained | the user | pull | yes | yes |
| A tracker task | anyone | pull | yes | yes |

Two columns carry the whole argument.

**Every durable inbound in this estate is pull.** A dump file, a tracker task,
an errand: each waits in a folder until something next looks. That is
robust and it is slow, and slowness is the correct trade for most of them. What
it cannot do is redirect work already under way.

The one exclusion in that first column is not a quibble: a session's own
comments are filtered before delivery, so it cannot reach itself through this
channel. See "It works on private repositories" below.

**Exactly one channel is both push and open to an outside agent.** A subscribed
PR comment is the only row that is durable, addressable, human readable, and
writable by anything holding a repo token, which includes an agent from another
vendor. `SendMessage` is faster and richer and is bounded by the account, so it
cannot serve a reader running somewhere else. That is not a shortcoming of
either; they answer different questions.

## The affordance nobody claimed

The estate moved to opening a pull request at first push rather than at the end
of the work. The stated reason was surfacing: the body becomes the live answer
to "where did I leave things."

A second consequence arrived with it and went unnoticed. **A PR that exists from
the first push is a standing, addressable inbox for the workstream, present
during the work rather than after it**, which is the only time an inbox is
useful. Under the old habit there was nothing to write to while the branch was
live. The channel was created as a side effect of a decision made for another
reason, and no convention claimed it.

[SURFACING.md](SURFACING.md) meanwhile said "never offer to watch CI or monitor a
PR." That rule was aimed at a monitoring posture, a session sitting on a red
build burning tokens. Its phrasing was broad enough to keep any session from
raising the inbound use at all, which is the failure [venues.md](venues.md) opens
by naming: not a document unread, but a question never asked.

## The join that already exists, pointing one way

A session's identity is already bound to its branch. Sessions write a
`Claude-Session:` commit trailer, the branch survey reads it, the activity cache
carries it per branch, and show-repo's Branches view links it. So the estate can
already answer "which session produced this branch."

Subscribing does not create that join and does not improve it. It adds the
reverse direction, which today does not exist: from the pull request back to the
session, live. The record points backwards in time; the subscription points
forwards.

## Two kinds of comment, and they must be distinguishable

A wake makes a session *act*. So a note parked for later and an instruction to
proceed arrive identically and are not identically intended. Without a marker,
every stray thought becomes a work order.

The marker is a leading token, read before anything else in the comment:

- `go:` — act on this. The rest of the comment is the instruction.
- **anything else** — incoming context. It informs whatever the session does
  next and creates nothing on its own.

There is no token for "do not act," and the absence is the design. **The safe
default has to be the unmarked case**, because the unmarked case is what a
person types without thinking about the protocol at all, and a scheme whose
safe path requires remembering a prefix fails exactly when someone is in a
hurry. One token to opt *in* to action, and silence everywhere else.

An outside agent writing into the thread uses the same vocabulary and should say
which agent it is in the first line. That is a courtesy and not a control: it
cannot be verified, for the reason the next section gives.

Adopted 2026-08-20, replacing an `@go`/`@note` pair drafted a few hours earlier
in this same file. The pair was worse for a reason worth keeping: it spent two
tokens to distinguish cases that only ever needed one, and it made the harmless
case something you could get wrong by forgetting.

## What was measured

Tested 2026-08-20 on [PR #464](https://github.com/mehrlander/web-tools/pull/464),
the pull request carrying this file.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Session subscribed | 20:57:05Z |
| Last activity in the session | about 20:57Z |
| Container running the session | booted about 20:37Z |
| That container | reclaimed at some point after 20:57Z |
| **A new container** | **booted 21:33:57Z** |
| Comment event delivered into the conversation | 21:37:02Z |
| Control: a scheduled self check-in | armed for 21:58Z, did not fire first |

**A PR comment revives a reclaimed container.** The container that ran the first
half of the session no longer existed. A new one was provisioned and the
conversation resumed inside it, carrying its full context, because somebody
commented. The scheduled check-in was armed as a control precisely so a pull
could not be mistaken for a push, and it was still twenty-one minutes away when
the wake landed. This is genuine asynchrony, and it is the strongest form of the
claim rather than the weak one.

**Cold start is a container cost, not a channel cost.** Boot preceded delivery by
3m 05s here, and a second test the same night, on a warm container, delivered in
**2 seconds** from GitHub timestamp to arrival. So the three minutes buys a
container, and only a session that has gone cold pays it. Warm, the channel is
effectively immediate. Treat three minutes as the worst case rather than the
expected one, and still write to it as asynchronous, since which case applies is
not knowable from the sending end.

### It works on private repositories, and self-comments never arrive

Measured 2026-08-21 on `web-tools-private#35`, a private repo. **A private
repository delivers**, which is what makes the channel usable at all: an inbound
message that had to be world-readable could carry nothing drawn from the session
corpus, the errands folder, or any other private material.

The same probe answered a question nobody had asked. Two comments sat on that one
pull request under one subscription:

| | posted | delivered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| posted by the session itself | 21:50:24Z | **never**, across 2h 35m |
| posted by someone else | 00:25:50Z | 00:25:52Z |

Both carry the same `user.login` and the same `author_association`. Nothing in
the GitHub record separates them, so **the echo filter keys on what the session
did, not on who wrote the comment**, and it runs before delivery rather than as
a judgment after it.

The consequence is worth more than the fact: **a session cannot verify this
channel from one end.** Posting to a subscribed thread and hearing nothing back
proves nothing about whether the subscription still works. Any check of a live
subscription needs a second party.

## The channel carries no authorship

The test comment arrived under the repo owner's account and its text said it was
written by an agent from another vendor acting through that account. **From
inside the session those two are indistinguishable**, and no probe available to
a session can separate them. Anything holding a token with write access to the
repository *is* the account, as far as an arriving event can show.

Two consequences, and the first is the one that matters:

- **A leading token states intent, never authority.** `@go` means "this is meant
  as an instruction," not "the person sanctioned this." An action that would be
  costly, destructive, or outward-facing still needs the person, and a comment
  is not the person even when it arrives under their name.
- **Claims in a comment are claims.** The test comment asserted that the private
  session corpus had been read successfully. Nothing in the comment cited that
  corpus, and the assertion is unverifiable from a session. It is recorded here
  as reported rather than confirmed.

The harness already treats this correctly and the treatment is worth naming,
since it is the mitigation rather than an inconvenience: an arriving event is
wrapped in a notice stating it is not user input, and the author and body are
flagged as untrusted. A session that reads those flags and still treats a comment
as consent has ignored the guard, not lacked one.

## Subscribing at creation, and what "automatic" can mean

The estate opens a pull request at first push, so the inbox exists early. Making
the session subscribe to it without a manual step splits into three parts, and
only one of them can be automatic.

**Detection can be.** `PostToolUse` takes a matcher on the tool name and can
return `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, described in the hook reference as
text that "lets a hook augment what Claude sees about the tool's result." A
matcher of `mcp__.*__create_pull_request` fires deterministically the moment a
pull request is created, with the tool result in hand, which carries the number.

**The subscribe call cannot be.** Hooks run shell commands.
`subscribe_pr_activity` is an MCP tool reachable only by the model, and it has no
command-line equivalent. Nothing in the hook system can invoke it. This is the
line the question has to be answered on: **detection is machinery, the call is
always the model.**

**So the achievable mechanism is deterministic detection plus a prompt delivered
at the exact moment, carrying the number.** That is meaningfully stronger than a
standing instruction in `CLAUDE.md`, which competes with everything else in
context and weakens as a session grows, and meaningfully weaker than a platform
feature, which does not exist as far as this estate has found. Call it reliable,
not automatic, and do not describe it as automatic in any convention, because a
reader who believes subscription is guaranteed will stop checking.

Where it lives, built 2026-08-20: the `portable` plugin's hook folder, beside
[`mcp-fail-hint.sh`](https://github.com/mehrlander/web-tools/blob/main/.claude/skills/hooks/mcp-fail-hint.sh),
as `pr-subscribe-hint.sh`, which is the identical shape (matcher on an MCP tool, payload off stdin,
guidance out through `additionalContext`). Two reasons, and the second is the
load-bearing one:

- The plugin travels to every repo, and the inbox is a per-workstream thing in
  every repo rather than a web-tools feature.
- **A project `.claude/settings.json` hook would not fire reliably.** A session
  can open with the repo one level below its root, and Claude Code then reads
  project settings from a path that does not exist, registering none of the
  repo's hooks. The estate hit exactly this, diagnosed it, and moved its
  build hook out of the harness for it; see
  [environment/extending.md](environment/extending.md). The plugin registers at
  user scope and runs from any root, which is why the dispatcher lives there.

### When a merged hook actually starts firing

The plugin declares no `version`, so Claude Code resolves it from the git commit
SHA of web-tools main and refreshes on every new commit there. That makes the
propagation sound simple, and it is off by one session.

**A plugin refresh happens at session start, but that session's hooks have
already run from the previous pin.** Observed twice in one session on
2026-08-20, which is why it is stated here rather than assumed:

```
portable@web-tools refreshed f53c558c4357 to 8bc79dbb0342;
  its hooks ran from the old pin, so /reload-plugins if you were
  waiting on a hook change
```

So the two halves of this change land on different schedules:

| | takes effect |
| --- | --- |
| the **convention** (SURFACING.md, CONVENTIONS.md) | the next session, since the loader and the injection hook fetch from main |
| the **hook** (`pr-subscribe-hint.sh`) | the session *after* the one that refreshes, or immediately on `/reload-plugins` |

The practical consequence: **the first session after a hook merge is the one
most likely to report the hook as broken**, because it refreshed to the new pin
and ran the old one. Check `/reload-plugins` before concluding anything about a
hook that just shipped. This is a narrower case of the two-copies problem the
estate already knows about, where the marketplace clone and the plugin cache
drift and `claude plugin list` reads the clone.

Two things such a hook must say, since both are silent failures otherwise:

- **A PR Steward already watching preempts the subscription.** The call still
  succeeds and the tool result says events will not arrive. Read the result text
  rather than assuming success.
- **Subscriptions accumulate**, measured 2026-08-20 and the reason the hook was
  safe to build. This session subscribed to web-tools#464, then to
  web-tools-private#35 at 21:50:18Z, and a comment on **#464** was delivered at
  22:30:33Z, forty minutes after the second subscription. The earlier one
  survived the later one. Had it not, auto-subscribing would have silently
  dropped the earlier workstream's inbox every time, and three repos on one
  branch name is ordinary here. The measurement fell out of the work rather than
  needing a probe of its own, which is worth noting only because the probe built
  to answer it was still pending when the answer arrived.

### It replaced a standing decision, on purpose

[SURFACING.md](SURFACING.md) said never offer to watch CI or monitor a pull
request. The harness attaches a **drive-to-green posture** to a pull request the
session created: once subscribed, a failing check is not to be left without a
pushed fix or a stated blocker. Those are the same subscription, so adopting the
inbox adopts the posture unless something separates them.

Rather than preserve the old rule beside the new behavior, which would have left
two rules disagreeing about the same event, the primitive was replaced on
2026-08-20 with the three-word split: **subscribe** once at creation, **receive
events** with no obligation attached to arrival, **act** per event. A `go:`
comment instructs; everything else is incoming context; a failing check is
addressed when it bears on work the session is responsible for.

What the old rule got right is kept, and it is worth saying which half that is:
a session should not burn tokens on a red build it had nothing to do with. What
it got wrong was reach. Phrased as "never monitor a PR," it concealed the inbound
channel for as long as it stood, because every session read it as covering the
errands folder too. **A rule stated broadly enough to be safe can hide a capability
without anyone noticing**, which is the same failure that let the early-PR
convention create this inbox unremarked. Both directions of that failure are now
on the record in one file.
