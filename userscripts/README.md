# Userscripts

Scripts for the [Userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) Safari
extension, the third way to run JavaScript on a page in iOS Safari beside a
bookmarklet and a Shortcuts "Run JavaScript on Web Page" action. It runs on
every matching URL with no tap and has no length limit; what it lacks on its own
is a way back, which is what the `Log-Repo` shortcut supplies.

**Install:** open the raw `.user.js` file in Safari and take the Install sheet.
Then, on a page the script matches, open the extension menu once and allow
Userscripts on every site: an iOS extension is silent on a site until it is
allowed there, and Safari only asks when the menu is opened. That cost one
detour on 2026-09-05, with the script installed and matched and nothing on
screen.

**Edit, without reinstalling.** The stub is pinned to a **branch**, so it never
changes and the phone never sees it again after the first install. Editing is:

```bash
vim userscripts/lib/launcher.js
python3 scripts/userscript-stub.py launcher --ref main --name 'wt launcher' \
    --description '...' --match '*://*/*'      # re-stamps the body
git commit && git push
```

**Pin `main`, not a working branch.** A branch pin is right while a script is
being built and wrong the moment its branch merges: deleting the branch 404s the
`@require`, and the installed script stops running with nothing on screen to say
why. Re-pin to main before merging, which costs one last install.

No purge, because the `@require` reads **raw.githubusercontent**, whose cache is
five minutes. jsDelivr was the first answer and was the wrong one for a file
edited several times an hour: it caches a branch for about twelve hours,
propagates a purge per edge, and rate-limits purging to roughly hourly per path.
Measured 2026-09-06, an hour after a push it still served two builds back with
the purge window closed, while raw already had the current one.

**The bookmarklet cannot follow it there**, so the two routes read different
hosts on purpose. Raw serves `text/plain` with `nosniff`, which a browser
refuses to execute from a script tag; jsDelivr serves it as JavaScript. So the
bookmarklet keeps the CDN and keeps needing the purge, and the generator prints
that URL. The test holds the two to the same ref and path, which is what decides
which body runs.

**A branch pin costs the one thing a commit pin gave free**, knowing which copy
ran, and a purge does not settle it either: jsDelivr propagates per edge, so for
a while after a push a reload can land on either body (measured 2026-09-06, six
of eight reads on the old one). Purging is also rate-limited, roughly hourly per
path. So the drawer header answers the freshness question three ways, each
weaker than the next but each available where the others are not:

| Shown | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `107ebdd` | which copy ran, always |
| `built 3h ago` | roughly how old it is, without a second number to compare |
| a warning line | that a different build is current, where the fetch is allowed |

The warning comes from [`builds.json`](builds.json), read from
raw.githubusercontent with a cache-buster rather than from the CDN, since a
manifest served by the cache it describes can be stale in exactly the case it
exists to detect. It **stays silent on failure**, because a strict `connect-src`
refuses that fetch and an unlooked-up answer reading as a good one is worse than
no verdict. `tools/test/userscript-stubs.test.mjs` holds the manifest to the
body and the stamp to the file it was computed from, and holds the stub and its
bookmarklet twin to one address. A body must define `window.wt<Lib>` and do nothing on load;
the stub calls it, so one body serves both routes.

**Which route reaches a page.** Measured against `script-src 'self'`: the
bookmarklet is refused, because it is a script tag the page injects; the
userscript mounts, because the extension evaluates the body itself. That is the
reason the launcher exists as a userscript and the reason its styles are a
constructed stylesheet rather than a `<style>` element, which `style-src` would
refuse the same way.

- [`launcher.user.js`](launcher.user.js): the app's own launcher, carried onto
  pages that have none, from [`lib/launcher.js`](lib/launcher.js). Same square,
  same mark, same drag, and a menu in the fab's row shape: capture the page to
  the repo, open the app, hide it.

  **It yields.** On a page that already has a fab it must not mount, or every
  web-tools page grows a second launcher beside the real one. Five tells stand
  it down: a mounted `[aria-label="Web-tools panel"]`, `window.gh`,
  `window.__fabHosted`, `data-no-fab`, and an observer that removes it if the
  real launcher boots after `document-end`.

  **The drawer is not the fab's**, and cannot be: Render reads the GitHub API
  through a token held on the web-tools origin, which a foreign origin does not
  have and must not be given, and Inspect lists what `gh.load()` fetched, which
  on a foreign page is nothing. What a foreign page does hold is its own
  content, so the three panes are the three answers it can give.

  | Pane | Holds |
  | --- | --- |
  | Page | title, address, description, and the selection, read on each open |
  | Links | every off-page link, deduped by address, each one tickable |
  | Text | the page's own prose, from its `<article>` or the densest block |

  The header carries a **refresh**, because a read is a moment and a news front
  page is not. **Collect** answers the harder version: a virtual-scroll feed
  removes rows as you pass them, so a read taken at the end sees the last screen
  and calls it the page. While Collect is on, every change to the document is a
  chance to keep blocks and links not kept yet, so scrolling accumulates.
  Measured against a list that never holds more than five rows: 45 items and 45
  links survived 40 passing through. Turning it off stops the watcher and keeps
  the tape; links accumulate whether or not it is on, so a refresh can never
  drop one you had ticked.

  **It measures the visible area, not the page.** iOS resolves `position: fixed`
  against the layout viewport, which on a page carrying an unclamped table, a
  wide ad slot or a pinch-zoom is wider than the screen; `vw` measures the same
  wrong thing, so a right-anchored panel hangs off the side and `max-width`
  does not save it. Everything is positioned inside one root sized from
  `visualViewport` and re-measured on its resize and scroll. Chromium already
  anchors fixed to the visual viewport, so this is not reproducible headless and
  was reasoned from a phone.

  **Two routes out, matched to size.** Send hands the capture to `Log-Repo` and
  it lands in the repo, but it rides inside a `shortcuts://` URL whose true
  ceiling nobody has measured (14,190 characters is known to work, and the
  failure past it would be a truncated payload arriving complete-looking). So
  Send is capped well under that and says `Copy only` when it stands down; Copy
  takes anything, the clipboard having no such limit. The cap is on the
  delivery, never on the selection.

## What the probe settled (2026-09-05)

`probe-require` was a two-route bar that ran once and is retired; its record is
[PR #601](https://github.com/mehrlander/web-tools/pull/601).

- The iOS build **does** fetch a remote `@require` (Userscripts 1.8.6, iOS 18.7),
  which is what makes the stub-and-body split above work at all.
- A `shortcuts://` link **tapped** inside a page reaches the shortcut, so a page
  has a return channel into `shortcuts/log/`. It has to be an anchor the finger
  lands on; assigning `location.href` is a navigation with no user gesture.
- `github.com` never reaches Safari on the phone, since the GitHub app claims
  the address. Test on a `github.io` page.
