# Retire .show-repo.json: delete the legacy file on migrate, drop the read fallback

The capability this task was filed for has shipped. `lib/alpineComponents/config.js`
is a structured `.web-tools.json` editor covering General, Projects, Pages, Stage,
and Scope, held by `tools/test/config-form.test.mjs`, and saving a config loaded
from the legacy `.show-repo.json` name already migrates it to `.web-tools.json`.
What remains is finishing the retirement of the legacy name:

- **Delete the old file on migrate.** The original scoping note said `gh-store.js`
  had no delete; it does now. After a legacy migrate save succeeds, call it on
  `.show-repo.json` so the repo does not carry two manifests. Say so in the toast.
- **Drop the read fallback at sunset.** `pages/show-repo/show-repo.html` carries
  the 2026-08-15 sunset marker on its legacy-name read entry, and both `config.js`'s
  `load()` and `repo.js`'s config read try the two names in turn. Once the
  estate's repos are migrated, remove every fallback and the migrate banner
  itself. (A fourth reader, `navigator.js`, was deleted with `nav-repo.html` on
  2026-08-14, so that copy is already gone.)

## Done when

A repo carrying only `.show-repo.json` can be migrated from the shell with the
old file removed in the same pass, and after the sunset date no code path reads
the legacy name.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-15: filed while wrapping PR #222 (the manifest rename). Migrate action
  scoped but not built; deferred here so the PR could wrap up.
- 2026-08-07: refined per the 2026-08-07 assessment (close-or-reframe). The
  general config editor and the migrate-on-save both shipped since filing,
  without this task being claimed; retitled to the true residual (legacy-file
  delete plus fallback removal) and dropped the stale `next:` tag.
- 2026-08-15: done on `claude/centralize-file-viewer-search-en30ye`, on the
  sunset date. The estate's config sweep (web-tools-private `state/configs.json`,
  2026-08-13, 18 repos) showed all nine configured repos already on
  `.web-tools.json` and none on the legacy name, which settled both bullets at
  once. The read fallback is gone from `show-repo.html`, `config.js`, `repo.js`, and
  `scripts/declared-paths.py`. The first bullet was NOT built: a delete-on-migrate
  for zero repos is a branch nobody can reach, so the whole migration path went
  instead (the legacy banner, `dlgLegacy`/`legacy`, and the migrate commit
  message and toast). A repo that turns up on the old name now reads as
  unconfigured, which the config editor already handles by writing the new name.
  The task's own body de-tokenizes the marker it cites, so a closed record does
  not scan as a live marker forever.
