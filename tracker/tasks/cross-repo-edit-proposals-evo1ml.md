# Confirm-gated cross-repo edit proposals via a web-tools-private channel

A way for an agent session (limited repo scope) to propose a change to a repo it
cannot reach, and have show-repo apply it later with the user's full-access
token, behind a manual confirm. The write-side counterpart to the existing
read-only mailbox: "farm out" an edit as a specified diff, hold it until the
user approves it in the app.

The motivating case: adding the per-repo `scope` field to the roster repos the
Map view lists (chat-histories, wa-bills, fn-data, shortcut-tools). A session
bound to home + web-tools + web-tools-private cannot write those repos, so today
it can only hand the user drafts to paste. This mechanism would let the session
drop the drafts as proposals and let the user apply them from show-repo.

## Starting points (all already in the codebase)

- **The mailbox is deliberately read-only.** `lib/repo-mailbox.js` +
  `web-tools-private/mailbox/` fulfill `tree | branches | fetch` on load, chosen
  so auto-fulfilling never spends write access on agent-authored instructions
  (see `web-tools-private/DESIGN.md`). A write channel is a real security-surface
  change and must not auto-apply; the whole safety hinge is the manual confirm.
- **The apply path exists.** `lib/gh-transfer.js` (show-repo's "Copy to repo")
  already writes files cross-repo via the token, with a two-tap confirm. A
  proposal apply is the same write behind the same gesture.
- **The config cache already reads the estate**, so the panel can show a
  proposal against a repo's current file.

## Shape (sketch, not settled)

- Agent writes `proposals/<id>.json` into web-tools-private: target `owner/repo`,
  path, new content or a patch, and a one-line why.
- show-repo, on load with a token, surfaces a **pending proposals** panel
  (never auto-applies): each proposal shows a diff against the target's current
  file.
- On the user's confirm, it commits to the target via `gh-transfer`; the
  proposal moves to a `results/`-style done state, the way the mailbox does.

## Ready drafts (the first proposals to apply)

Draft `scope` values for the four roster repos not yet carrying one, authored
2026-07-23 from home's `repos/*.md` notes and the registry roster. Paste-ready
into each repo's `.web-tools.json`; treat as starting points, and confirm each
repo's visibility (the doctrine keys the boundary on it).

- **chat-histories** (confident, private): "The chat archive: raw conversations
  plus the catalogs, arcs, and indexes that navigate them, all keyed by chat URL
  (GUIDE.md). Private, since it is a personal conversation record, and referenced
  from other repos by chat URL rather than vendored."
- **wa-bills** (confirm visibility): "Washington State legislation as structured
  data and its tooling: bill corpora across many biennia (JSON and CSV, with a
  catalog index) plus the subprojects that extract, normalize, and analyze bill
  structure, budget bills especially. Downstream analysis in home draws on its
  corpus by reference rather than copying it in."
- **fn-data** (thinnest, confirm contents): "Fiscal-note data: OFM fiscal-note
  pulls kept as a standalone source for the budget and pension work to draw on,
  with its own refresh cadence separate from the analysis that consumes it."
- **shortcut-tools** (confirm visibility): "An Apple Shortcuts reference: an
  action dictionary mapping human-readable names to WFWorkflowActionIdentifier
  values across the built-in and third-party bundles, packaged with a small CLI
  to search it. A self-contained dataset and tool, useful on its own."

## Open questions

- Patch vs whole-file content (whole-file is simpler and matches gh-transfer;
  a patch needs a 3-way apply).
- Where the panel lives: an estate view, or folded into the Map / a repo dialog.
- Batching several proposals into one confirm vs one-at-a-time.
- Whether this subsumes or sits beside the mailbox (both are agent-to-app
  channels; one reads, one proposes writes).

## Progress log
- 2026-07-23: Filed. Surfaced while adding `scope` to the roster from a session
  that could not reach those repos (the Map view work, web-tools PRs #281/#282).
  The read-only mailbox and gh-transfer are the two halves to build between.
- 2026-07-28: first cut done on `claude/tracker-status-cjogjn`, landing via
  web-tools PR #302 and web-tools-private PR #8. `lib/repo-proposals.js` is the
  contract (pending/applied dirs, validate, resolve, apply, and the tombstone
  convention borrowed from the mailbox);
  `lib/alpineComponents/proposals.js` is the review view at `?view=proposals`,
  a nav entry that appears only while something is pending. Every row resolves
  against the live target and shows the bytes the write would send, and Apply
  is a two-tap confirm through gh-transfer's saveRaw. Two kinds shipped:
  `put-file` and `set-json-field`, the latter a read-modify-write so a session
  that cannot read the target proposes a field rather than guessing at the rest
  of the file. Tests: `tools/test/repo-proposals.test.mjs` (12) and
  `tools/test/proposals-view.test.mjs` (6), plus a stubbed headless shot
  (`tools/render/scripts/proposals-demo.mjs`).
  The four `scope` drafts above are staged as pending proposals in
  web-tools-private; applying them is the user's tap, and each still wants its
  visibility confirmed, which is what the review pane is for.
  Deliberately not built, and not yet tasks: a patch kind (whole-file and
  field-set cover the cases at hand), batching several proposals into one
  confirm, and any proposal a repo could send rather than receive. The panel
  lives in its own estate view rather than folded into the Map or the repo
  dialog, on the grounds that a pending write is not a property of any one repo.
