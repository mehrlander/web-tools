# Generalize FAB embed handling to declared embeds

The parked "layer chooser" idea from the FAB/embed work (PR #279): let the
FAB re-target at an embedded page while staying on the host, instead of (or
beside) busting out to the embed's full-page form.

Decision at filing: not built, on purpose. The two shipped mechanisms cover
every current case, under the rule "adopt when the host exists to render a
subject; bust out when the host merely contains one":

- toss-render adopts its subject fully (Render + Inspect, via
  `__tossSubject`/`__tossFrame`), automatically, because the subject is the
  whole point of the page.
- show-repo offers a one-tap bust-out action (FAB actions contract) for its
  landing / app-view / atlas iframes; fabs inside iframes decline to mount.

A chooser would deliver a strictly weaker version of bust-out (host chrome,
nested frames, a second axis of FAB state muddying the launcher's mode
indicator) at real complexity: the landing case is two frames deep, and the
outer FAB would have to reimplement adoption through toss-render's frame.

Trigger condition: a genuinely composite page, several live interactive
embeds side by side where "open full-page" destroys the composition that is
the point. No such page exists in the estate today.

Sketch when triggered: a host component declares its embeds the way it
declares `description`/`actions` (an `embeds: [{label, src, frame}]` array
the FAB scans); the FAB lists them and generalizes subject adoption from
"the one toss subject" to "a selected embed", reusing `__tossFrame`-style
handles. Done means: the FAB can describe and re-render a chosen embed on a
composite page without leaving it.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-22: Filed as the parked item 4 from the FAB sidebar / branch-nav
  session (PR #279), with the do-not-build-yet rationale and trigger recorded.
