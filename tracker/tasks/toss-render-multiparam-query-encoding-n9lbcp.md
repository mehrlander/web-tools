# toss-render ?query forwarding drops multi-param page queries

## Symptom

`#gh=owner/repo@ref:path?query` hands the `?query` to the rendered page (the
params shim). It works for a single param (`?view=stage`), but a multi-param
page query with a bare `&` is silently truncated. Example that fails:

```
#gh=mehrlander/web-tools@<ref>:pages/show-repo/show-repo.html?view=app&appRepo=X&appPath=Y
```

The page receives only `view=app`; `appRepo` and `appPath` arrive as `null`, so
a deep link that needs all three routes to the wrong view (the app-view deep
link fell back to the estate front door).

## Cause (confirmed)

toss-render reads the fragment with `new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1))`
(line ~145). URLSearchParams splits the whole fragment on `&` first, so the `&`
inside the `gh` value ends the `gh` param and turns `appRepo=X&appPath=Y` into
sibling fragment params that `showAddress` never sees. The `gh` value is
truncated at the first `&`, i.e. right after `?view=app`.

The workaround is to percent-encode the page query's `&` as `%26`, so it stays
inside the `gh` value and decodes back after URLSearchParams splits. That is a
sharp edge: the head comment and the on-page help show only single-param
examples, so a hand-written multi-param link looks right and quietly misbehaves.

## Fixes (possible)

- Extract `gh` from the raw fragment by string slice (find `gh=`, take the rest)
  rather than via URLSearchParams, so a bare `&` in the value survives. Guard the
  other fragment keys (`gz`, `html`, `url`) that legitimately want URLSearchParams.
- Or: keep the parse, and document the `%26` requirement in the head comment and
  the on-page help, plus have "Copy toss link" emit `%26` for any minted
  multi-param query.

Low urgency: single-param deep links (the common case) work, and callers can
encode `%26`. Worth smoothing so a hand-written link is not a trap.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-19: filed from the app-views session (web-tools PR #242), where the
  News app-view deep link failed until the `&` was encoded as `%26`.
- 2026-07-30: fixed, taking both listed fixes rather than choosing between them.
  The fragment now goes through `readFragment(hash)`, which matches the one
  leading key and takes the whole rest of the string as its value, then decodes
  percent-escapes (so `%26` links keep resolving) and falls back to the raw
  value when the escaping is invalid. The query string keeps
  `URLSearchParams`, where `&` really does delimit. The head comment and the
  on-page help now show a multi-param example and name the query string's limit.

  Two differences from the old reader, both deliberate. `+` is no longer turned
  into a space at this level: the params shim re-parses the page query with
  `URLSearchParams`, which decodes `+` where it means something, and a `+` in a
  path is a literal. And a fragment can no longer carry a second key, which no
  minted link did (checked across `lib/`, `pages/`, `docs/`, `tools/`).

  Two tests. `tools/test/toss-fragment.test.mjs` lifts `readFragment` out of the
  page source and runs it, in `npm test`. `tools/test/toss-multiparam.mjs` is
  the browser half, since the params shim only means anything once the framed
  document runs: it tosses a probe page through the real shell and reads back
  what the page's own `URLSearchParams` returns. Against main's reader the
  browser check fails on exactly the two params the task named
  (`appRepo` and `appPath` come back `null`), which is the A/B the fix is worth.
  It also measures the query string's limit as a control, so the documented
  caveat has a number behind it.
