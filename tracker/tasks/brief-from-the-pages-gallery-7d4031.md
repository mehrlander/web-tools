# Reach the take-away menu from show-repo's Pages gallery

The Pages gallery (the inline `gallery()` in `app/index.html`)
is where a person is already looking at pages, so it is the natural place to
say "take that one."
The take-away menu that does it lives in the FAB on the page itself (PR #295).
Connect the two.

## The constraint that decides the design

Do **not** rebuild the menu on the card. A gallery card holds a path and
nothing else, and the fileset a brief needs is the page's *runtime* closure,
which only a running page knows. Measured while building the kit: grepping
`shorter.html` statically finds 3 `gh.load` calls; the page actually loads 9.
A card-side guess is wrong by 3x and wrong silently.

So the card should **link into** the FAB, not duplicate it: open the page with
the drawer already on the take-away menu. That needs a small addition on the
FAB side (honor a query parameter or hash that opens the drawer to a given tab
and menu), which is also useful on its own for any link that wants to point at
the drawer.

## Notes

Depends on the focus task only loosely: if per-region scope lands first, the
gallery link should carry that too rather than being retrofitted twice.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-26: Filed from PR #295 wrap-up, where the gallery entry point was
  proposed and deliberately not built.
- 2026-08-14: Re-aimed. The gallery this task names is show-repo's inline
  `gallery()`, which became a standing per-repo view that day; the separate
  `lib/alpineComponents/pages.js`, which the task had pointed at, was deleted
  with its only mount (`nav-repo.html`). The design is unaffected: the card
  still holds a path and still has to link into the FAB rather than rebuild it.
