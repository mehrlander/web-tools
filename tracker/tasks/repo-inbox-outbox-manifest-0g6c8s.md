# Repo-designated inbox and outbox in .web-tools.json

Give a repo a designated deposit location (inbox) and a designated staging
location for material it is making available to be pulled (outbox). This joins
the existing repo-designated manifest configs (`landing`, `pins`, `stage`)
rather than introducing a new mechanism: `inbox` and `outbox` are two more
fields the `.web-tools.json` manifest can declare.

Prerequisite context: inbox follows the "unify the deposit destination" work
(the drop-in and the copy-to-repo share one `owner/repo[@ref]:dir` destination
and one repo-first `@` picker, defaulting to root when empty). That default is
the seam inbox extends: root becomes the fallback, a declared inbox the
preferred default.

## Inbox: where an unaddressed deposit lands

- **Designate, with a soft convention fallback.** A repo declares its inbox in
  `.web-tools.json` (e.g. `inbox: "inbox/"`). A deposit that names no dir uses
  it; a repo that declares none falls back to root. Optionally a convention
  default (`inbox/`) sits between the two, so every conventions-following repo
  has a sane default without hand-declaring one. Decide whether the convention
  default is on by default or opt-in when building.
- **The inbox belongs to the destination repo's manifest.** For a cross-repo
  deposit the inbox is the *receiver's* declared location, so the tool must
  fetch the destination repo's `.web-tools.json`; the stager probes only the
  open repo's manifest today. One extra call keyed to the picked repo, plus a
  404/no-manifest branch.
- **Soft, not auto.** Do not have a background action mint the inbox folder.
  Pre-fill the inbox as the destination and let the existing two-tap commit be
  the consent that creates it, matching how the stage's `send()` already guards
  cross-repo writes.

## Outbox: where a repo stages material to be pulled

The corollary of inbox, not a duplicate: inbox is the receiver's declared
landing spot for an incoming deposit; outbox is a sender's declared staging
spot for material it is making available, for another session, tool, or human
to pull from. Symmetric field shape (`outbox: "outbox/"` or an
`@ref`, see below), same soft/not-auto posture as inbox.

**The public-repo case is the reason this is worth building, not just
symmetry for its own sake.** Every cross-repo handoff mechanism documented so
far (`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`'s 🗂️ stage-a-fileset primitive, the `#stage=` /
`#gh=` forms in `docs/show-repo.md`) is token-gated: it authenticates against
a private repo or branch via the viewer's stored token, and fails outright in
a token-less context (the Claude app's in-app browser, a reader with no
authorized token). `docs/show-repo.md`'s roadmap names the gap directly: "a
content-carrying `#gz=`-style stage bundle for token-less contexts" is
"contemplated but not built." For a **public** repo, an outbox sidesteps that
gap instead of closing it: `raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/<ref>/path`
serves with no auth, on any branch, so a session can push to a public repo's
outbox and hand out a plain raw URL that works for anyone, no bundle, no
token. Private repos still need the artifact/bundle route; this is a
public-repo-specific shortcut, not a replacement for the token-gated forms.

## Open design question: folder or branch, for both

Neither field has to be a directory path. `inbox`/`outbox` could instead name
a **branch** (or `owner/repo@ref` style ref), and there's a real case for
leaning that way for both fields, not just one:

- **Reuses addressing that already exists.** show-repo's whole grammar is
  `owner/repo[@ref]:path`. If inbox/outbox name a ref, `gh-api.js`, the stage
  grammar, and toss-render's `#gh=` all handle it with no new plumbing; a
  folder-only design is a second addressing scheme to build and maintain
  alongside the one already there.
- **Keeps transient bulk off main's permanent history.** An inbox or outbox is
  drop-and-pick-up content by nature, not something anyone treats as part of
  the reviewed codebase. This repo already treats generated/transient content
  that way elsewhere (the board is regenerated not appended-to, thumbnails are
  the one deliberate non-deterministic exception, `dist/` stays gitignored
  except the tracked pre-build). A folder on main means that bulk rides main's
  linear history forever; a dedicated branch can be reset or force-pushed with
  no git-archaeology cost, since nothing treats it as citable history the way
  main is.
- **Cost: discoverability.** A folder shows up in normal repo browsing; a
  branch doesn't unless something points at it. Closable the same way
  `landing`/`pins` already are: the manifest names the ref, and show-repo (or
  a raw-fetch instruction) reads the manifest to find it.

Settle this before building either field; it plausibly changes the field's
shape (a bare path string vs. something that can also carry `@ref`).

## Open decisions (settle when building)

- Folder vs. branch for inbox/outbox (new, above) — likely settled first,
  since it shapes the field format for everything below.
- Convention default on by default, or opt-in (for inbox; decide separately,
  or the same way, for outbox).
- Field name and shape: single `inbox`/`outbox` strings, or nested under the
  existing `stage` block (`stage.inbox`, `stage.outbox`). Originally scoped as
  receive-side only, resisting a send-side field "until a second consumer
  needs it" — the public-repo raw-URL case above is that second consumer, so
  build both together now rather than deferring outbox again.

**Not in scope:** folding a dropped local file into the ref-based stage list as
a first-class item (the deferred PR #219 fold). That is the deeper "one deposit
pipeline" change; this task is only about the default *location(s)*.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-15: Filed (as inbox-only) during the stage-copy UX assessment.
- 2026-07-15: Expanded to inbox + outbox during a chat discussion tying
  together the inbox task, show-repo's staging conventions, and the
  token-gating gap in the cross-repo handoff primitives. Added the
  public-repo raw-URL outbox case and the folder-vs-branch design question for
  both fields. Still backlog; no branch claimed.
