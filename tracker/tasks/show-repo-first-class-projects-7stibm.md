# show-repo: first-class projects, defined by tracker presence

Give show-repo a project layer for repos that hold several workspaces, with
one defining convention: a `tracker/` directory marks a workspace. At the repo
root it marks the repo itself; nested (home's `projects/budget-drs/tracker/`,
`projects/budget-wa/tracker/`) it marks a project. "Repo or project" then
needs no separate registry of what counts: whatever runs a tracker is a
first-class unit, and giving projects first-class treatment gives trackers
first-class treatment in the same stroke.

## Why
home is one repo carrying several real operations (budget-drs, budget-wa,
bills, fiscal-notes), each with its own front door, board, and renderable
artifacts, but show-repo today presents the repo as one flat tree with one
landing. The concrete prompt: budget-wa's spend operation has a toss-renderable
estate page and a rich analysis layer that a reader cannot reach as a unit;
the budget-drs app links out to a GitHub tree URL because there is no project
landing to point at. Origin: the 2026-07-22 budget-drs contracts session
(home PR #333).

## Scope
- **Discovery.** How the shell learns a repo's projects: walk for `tracker/`
  directories (API-costly on big trees), read a committed registry (home
  already generates `trackers.md` via `tools/generate-tracker-registry.py`),
  or declare them in `.web-tools.json`. Likely answer: manifest declaration
  with the registry as generator, so discovery is one fetch.
- **Project landing.** Per project: its README lead, its board (On deck and
  In progress at minimum), its pins or renderable front door (a 🥏-able page
  like budget-wa's estate map), in the idiom of the existing repo landing.
- **Board rendering.** Boards become navigable surfaces in the shell rather
  than raw markdown blobs; this is the "first-class trackers" half.
- **Stage and link grammar.** Whether a project gets an addressable handle in
  links (`#project=` or a landing path), so a session can hand over "open
  budget-wa" as one tap.

## Definition of done
- A repo with nested trackers presents its projects as navigable units in
  show-repo, each with a landing that surfaces its board and front door.
- The defining convention (tracker presence marks a workspace) recorded in
  docs/show-repo.md, with the discovery mechanism named in the manifest docs.

## Progress log
- 2026-07-22 filed from the home budget-drs contracts session, where the
  missing project landing forced a bare GitHub tree link as the "comprehensive
  operation" target.
