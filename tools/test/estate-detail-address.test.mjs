// alpineComponents/estate.js — the branch takeover's own address.
//
// Being inside the swiper is a state, and until 2026-08-07 it was the only
// state in this view with no address: the list had `?view=branches`, the branch
// had its standalone page, and the reader in between could be reached only by
// tapping. It now stamps `&detail=owner/repo@branch`, follows a swipe, and
// clears on close, which is what makes Back leave the takeover rather than the
// whole view.
//
// The one case worth pinning beyond the round trip is a link to a branch the
// current list does not hold (a filter hides it, or it landed since the link
// was minted). That link still has to open something, because a link that
// silently resolves to nothing is worse than one with nowhere to swipe.
