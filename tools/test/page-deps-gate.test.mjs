// The ready gate every pre-build page needs, checked statically.
//
// The hazard: importing dist/web-tools.js BOOTS ALPINE as part of the import,
// because alpine-bundle.js is the last entry in its auto-boot chain. So a page
// written as
//
//     await import('../dist/web-tools.js');   // ← Alpine starts in here
//     await gh.load('kits/whatever.js');      // ← runs after init() already did
//
// has already run its components' init() by the time it loads the kits those
// components read. Whichever kit init() touches first is the one that appears
// undefined, so the same bug reports differently depending on the page and on
// how far init gets: measured 2026-08-07 as `reviewTarget.parse` on one path
// and `BranchBrief.fetchBrief` one await later on another, from a real browser.
//
// The build already fixed this for its own two cases, forcing url-params.js and
// repo-address.js into the auto-boot chain "because a page's own gh.load chain
// runs AFTER this import" (tools/build/build-lib.mjs). That does not extend to a
// kit only one page wants, so each such page states its own readiness.
//
// This is a STATIC check and that is its honest limit: it proves the gate is
// declared, resolved, and awaited, not that a given component awaits it before
// every kit it touches. It exists because the failure is a race, so a passing
// run proves nothing on its own and only the shape can be pinned.
