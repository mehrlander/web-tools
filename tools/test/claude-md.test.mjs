// CLAUDE.md itself: the two things the repo asks of its own agent
// instructions, which are not the same thing and no longer share a name.
//
// Both assertions lived inside routes-manifest.test.mjs until 2026-08-05,
// under the single name "CLAUDE.md delegates rather than restating". That was
// a misfiling with a cost. The routes manifest has nothing to do with how long
// CLAUDE.md is, so a session that grew the file by adding an unrelated section
// met a failure whose message blamed the showing material and pointed at a
// file it had not touched. The honest reading was "this file is too long";
// what the message taught instead was "shave something until the number goes
// down", and one session did exactly that before catching itself.
//
// Nothing about the checks changed in the move: same threshold, same
// assertions, same corpus. Only the grouping, the names, and what the failure
// tells you to do about it.
