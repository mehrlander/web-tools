// Every loadable lib file parses, the way the loader parses it.
//
// The suite is browser-free by construction, which is a feature and has one
// hole: nothing here ever asked whether a lib file is even syntactically
// valid. A file that fails to parse is not a subtle defect, but it is a quiet
// one, because `gh.load` catches the SyntaxError, warns to the console, and
// leaves the pre-build's inlined copy of the component running. The page keeps
// working, at the previous version, and only a console read says otherwise.
//
// Measured 2026-08-14, in this repo, on lib/alpineComponents/fab.js: a comment
// inside the component's HTML template happened to quote an identifier in
// backticks, which closed the enclosing template literal. The page rendered
// perfectly, at the last build's markup, through four screenshots taken to
// check the very change that had failed to load.
//
// `new Function(src)` is the check because it is exactly what the loader does
// with these files (docs/loader.md): they are function bodies, not modules, so
// this compiles them under the same rules and runs nothing. The real ES modules
// under lib/ are excluded, since `export` or a top-level `await` is a parse
// error in a function body and would fail here for the wrong reason. Two say so
// by their own syntax; lib/entry.js has neither import nor export, only
// top-level await, so it is named.
