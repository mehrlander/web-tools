// properties-registry.test.mjs — holds docs/registries.csv and docs/properties.csv,
// the registry pair behind docs/registries.md, to the files they govern.
//
// Since 2026-08-16 the pair governs ITSELF: both have a row in registries.csv and
// every one of their columns has a property definition, which is how `kind` finally
// carries a value domain instead of a special rule.
//
// The model's integrity rules, as checks: every governed registry exists and
// parses; within one, row fields are exactly the declared key plus declared
// properties (an undeclared field is an unaccounted classification, the drift
// the registry exists to catch; a declared property absent everywhere is a
// stale declaration); every computed declaration names a deriver that exists,
// and no recorded declaration names one. The registry is NOT a schema
// registry: registry-level blocks (notes, glossaries) are outside the rule,
// and files it does not govern are untouched.
//
// `fields` is the reconciliation's addition (2026-08-09), and it is now a
// PROHIBITION rather than a ledger: the assertion below reads zero. The estate ran
// thirteen registry-like mechanisms while six were declared, and five of the
// seven found could not be field-governed for reasons that are facts about the
// file rather than neglect: a bare array of groups, a deriver that ships in
// the plugin rather than this repo, four sibling blocks in one file, an index of
// prose, a target that is a manifest key. Declaring them `ungoverned` with a
// written `why` counts them instead of omitting them, which is the same
// count-rather-than-ban posture the registries run for authored judgment. The
// number is asserted below so it can only move deliberately.
//
// It moved four times in two days, always down, and ended at zero: all five
// reasons were wrong on inspection, two being false statements about the repo
// and three being statements about this gate mistaken for statements about a
// registry. So the ledger became a prohibition. `fields` survives only so that
// adding an ungoverned registry has to change this test, which is a deliberate
// act; the record says such a reason is more likely an unchecked assumption
// than a fact. docs/registries.md carries the five and what each got wrong.
