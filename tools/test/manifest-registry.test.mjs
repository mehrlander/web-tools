// docs/manifest-fields.csv — the field registry for root `.web-tools.json`.
//
// Flat since 2026-08-16. Members of an array or object key used to be nested
// inside their parent row as `subfields`, which meant the registry counted 20 rows
// while its own scope claimed "every key in use". There were 46. They are rows
// now, addressed pages[].path and stage.files, and the parent/child split is
// derived from the key rather than from the shape of the file.
//
// The registry replaces a 3,000-word prose field reference that sat inside
// docs/show-repo.md. Prose could not be checked against anything, and the cost
// showed: `quickLink` was live in two of the estate's four manifests and
// appeared in no field list at all. That is the failure this file exists to
// make loud.
//
// The gate runs one way, and the asymmetry is the point. Every key PRESENT in a
// real manifest must have a row, because an undocumented key in use is the
// defect. The reverse does not hold: every field is optional by design, so a
// row with no current user is a documented field nobody happens to need, not a
// stale row. Completeness in that direction would punish documenting a field
// before adopting it.
//
// The corpus is this repo's own manifest plus any sibling checkout that has
// one. Siblings are opportunistic: a session with only web-tools checked out
// still gets the local check, and one with the estate beside it gets the whole
// picture. A missing sibling is not evidence of anything, so it is skipped
// rather than failed, the same posture dead-links.py takes on an absent store.
