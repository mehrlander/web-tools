// alpineComponents/state-view.js — the Activity group: two caches, one press.
//
// Branches and Sessions are two crawls over two sources into two files, and the
// State view drew them as two rows with a Refresh each. The split is real
// underneath and was wrong on screen, since a session ending moves both at
// once. So the rows stayed two and the button became one.
//
// What is worth holding here is the fold and the wiring, because both fail
// quietly. A group whose members drifted apart would still render, as two boxed
// rows with one button that refreshed one of them; a group naming a shell
// method that no longer exists would render an enabled button that does
// nothing. Neither shows up in a screenshot.
//
// The bar each row draws while its own half runs is state-view-progress.test.mjs.
//
// No network, no pixels.
