// `reach: injected`. A word in them is a runtime cost paid on every turn, which

//
// CLAUDE.md has had a ceiling since 2026-08-03 (claude-md.test.mjs) and has
// moved +0.1% since. These two had none and moved +25% and +27% over the same
// window, then needed a hand cut. Same gate, same remedy, two more files.
//
// If one fails, see docs/CONVENTIONS.md ("Prose that describes state is
// unimplemented"). Look to trim redundant state details, enforced rules, or
// duplicated content. Material could also be moved, to a doc that is not
// injected or to data the app renders. Sessions load these every turn, in
// every repo, so use the skills/state-the-rule pass.

// Raising a limit requires user approval.

// move whenever either document changes size, so re-measure rather than trusting
