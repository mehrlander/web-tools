// The app view's address: `?app=`, and the namespace split behind its deep link.
//
// An app view is a page some repo promotes to an estate-level entry. It was
// addressed as five query keys naming the page's location; it now also answers
// to `?app=<slug>`, a name the promoting repo declares, which is short because
// a path is most of an address and none of the meaning.
//
// The deep link into such a page is the part with a real design in it, and the
// rule is stated in lib/kits/url-params.js and pinned in url-params.test.mjs:
// THE SHELL OWNS THE QUERY, THE FRAGMENT IS THE SUBJECT'S. What is left for
// this file is the wiring the kit cannot see, and one measurement that is the
// entire reason the split exists rather than a reserved-name convention.
//
// Source assertions rather than a mounted shell, following app-routes.test.mjs:
// the shell's component is a 3,000-line inline literal with no export, and the
// logic worth executing has been moved to the kit where it can be.
