// alpineComponents/estate.js — a session row's repo SCOPE.
//
// The record has carried `repos` since schema 1 and the pane never printed it,
// so the pane could not answer "where was this session" for the row a reader was
// actually on. The strip is that answer, and its whole job is to be the union of
// two fields that disagree on purpose: `attached` (what the container held) and
// `repos` (where the shell actually stood).
//
// Two link-minting getters lived here and are gone with the row buttons they
// served (2026-09-06): a second Claude mark and a microphone on every session
// row was more furniture than the row could carry, and the route to a new
// session belongs on a detail surface where it can say what it will do. What
// survives is the strip, and `kits/prompt-link.js` still holds the minting.
//
// Driven over the same fake GH as estate-sessions; no network, no pixels.
