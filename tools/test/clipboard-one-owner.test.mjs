// textarea fallback: chat-render and vanilla-demo byte-identical, session-export
// the same idea returning a boolean, md-doc already delegating. The block is not
// boilerplate but the iOS recipe kits/io.js documents at length, so four copies
// were four places for it to drift, and three had already drifted on what they
// returned.
//
// The gate is deliberately about the FALLBACK, not about `navigator.clipboard`:
// a kit may reach the modern API directly as its no-io.js degradation, and the
// delegates do exactly that. What no kit may re-implement is the legacy path.
