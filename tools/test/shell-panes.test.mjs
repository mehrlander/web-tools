// show-repo's swipe carousel: the two lists that have to agree.
//
// A dashboard view is swipeable only if its container carries data-pane, since
// that attribute is what the pager's element lookup keys on. estateNav is the
// other list, the ordered set of stops the gesture walks. They drifted: the
// lookup answered 'estate' and 'stage' alone while the nav had already grown
// Tools, Map, and Proposals, so a swipe could page INTO one of those (the
// commit runs the tab's own go()) and then found no pane and no-op'd. The
// carousel was a one-way trip, and nothing reported it, because a pane lookup
// that returns null is also the correct answer on a repo view.
//
// So this asserts the join rather than either side: for every nav stop, the
// pane key the shell computes exists in the markup. The shell's app() lives
// inline in app/index.html, hence the shell.mjs harness.
