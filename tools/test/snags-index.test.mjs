// The snags index's parser and its repeat detector.
//
// The generated table is already held to its source by the derived-artifacts gate, but
// that only proves the bytes match what the code produces. It says nothing
// about whether the code produces the right thing, and the part most able to
// go quietly wrong is the DETECTOR: a wrong table is visible on the page, while
// a detector that has stopped detecting looks exactly like a log with no
// repeats in it.
//
// Three tunable numbers decide what it catches: two or more shared tokens, the
// stop-word list, and the three-character floor on a token. Tighten the stop
// list and a real repeat stops firing; loosen the threshold and the commit hook
// prints noise until nobody reads it. Both failures are silent, so both are
// pinned here.
//
// The parser gets the same treatment for one specific reason: its boundary rule
// changed twice in one sitting, and the wrong version reported a snag as seen
// fourteen times when it was seen once. The cases below are the two readings
// that were actually gotten wrong.
