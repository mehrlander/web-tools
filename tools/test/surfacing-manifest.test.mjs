// docs/surfacing.csv — the machine index of the surfacing primitives. Unlike
// routes.json, the PROSE is the authoritative carrier here: SURFACING.md is
// what sessions load and follow, and the manifest is its gated index for the
// Map view's Surfacing tab. This test holds membership two-way: every
// primitive bullet's bold lead-in in SURFACING.md has a manifest row, and
// every row points at a real bullet. The summaries are paraphrases and stay
// unchecked, which docs/docs.csv's claims table says out loud.
