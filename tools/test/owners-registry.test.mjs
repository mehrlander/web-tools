// docs/owners.csv + docs/repetitions.csv — the owners registry: for a statement repeated across the
// hub's coordination layer, which carrier is authoritative and how every other
// mention relates to it.
//
// This gate is the reconciliation's answer to the one real maintenance hole the
// table had. Until 2026-08-09 the only check on it asserted `length > 3` ("the
// seed claims are present") and the row shape. Nothing verified that a cited
// carrier still existed, so the table could rot silently and the question "will
// anyone keep this current" was unanswerable rather than merely unanswered.
// Measured at the time this landed: 29 path-shaped references, 0 unresolved.
// The point of resolving them on every run is that the number stays honest.
//
// What is deliberately NOT checked: coverage. The registry is curated against a
// written scope (the `scope` field), and whether some fourth document has begun
// repeating a statement nobody has filed is not decidable from the carrier. The
// detectors answer that question (home's tools/duplicated-claims.py,
// local-models/instruments/concept-lab/termlab.py); a registry gate here would only assert that the
// file agrees with itself.
