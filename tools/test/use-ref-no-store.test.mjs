// Every `?use=<ref>` loader fetches past the HTTP cache.
//
// `?use=` is the repo's preview mechanism, and the ref it pins is almost always
// a BRANCH, which moves with every push. The loaders fetch that ref's bundle
// from raw.githubusercontent and blob-import it, and two page comments claimed
// for months that the blob import made "a branch name cache-safe". It does not:
// the blob import defeats the module cache, keyed by URL, and nothing was
// defeating the HTTP cache, keyed by the same URL. So a preview link could
// serve a bundle from an earlier push, showing old code with nothing on screen
// to say so.
//
// That cost a whole session of rounds: a fix was shipped, the preview still
// showed the old behavior, and the obvious readings (a broken fix, a stale CDN,
// the viewer's browser) were all wrong. The failure is invisible by
// construction, which is exactly the kind that needs a test rather than care.
//
// A guard rather than a behavior check: this asserts over the source of every
// page that speaks the grammar, because the bug is a missing argument in files
// nobody edits together.
