// docs/tests.csv — the test registry, and the gate that keeps it honest.
//
// This is the documents registry pointed at the suite instead of at docs/. The
// registry answers "what is this file and what keeps it true"; this answers
// "what does this check and what breaks without it". Both exist because a
// count is not an inventory: `npm test` reports a pass total that cannot tell
// a boot smoke check from an adversarial gate, and 96 files is already past
// the point where anyone holds the shape in their head.
//
// Completeness runs both ways here, unlike the manifest registry. Every file
// under tools/test/ must have a row and every row must exist, because a test
// file that nobody has classified is exactly the thing this is for. The
// browser-driven checks are included on purpose: they are named without
// `.test.` so `node --test` skips them, which means the suite's own pass count
// is silent about whether they still run at all.
//
// `protects` is a ledger, not a ban. A blank one marks a test nobody has yet
// said anything about, and the count is the honest measure of how much of the
// suite is unexamined. If it climbs, rows are being added to satisfy the gate
// rather than to say something.
