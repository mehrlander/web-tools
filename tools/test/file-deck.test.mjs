// kits/file-deck.js — a changeset's files, one per slide.
//
// The Files pane is for SCANNING and this is for READING, and the split is the
// whole design: the pane keeps thirty hairline rows a reader can sweep, and the
// deck takes one file at a time with the diff already open. The deck can afford
// that because swipe-deck mounts the active slide and its two neighbours, so
// three cards exist at once no matter how long the changeset is; the pane
// cannot, which is why it hedges its cards closed past a dozen files.
//
// It also ANNOUNCES what the reader is on, through the subject channel the FAB
// sidebar already listens to (window.__tossSubject plus a 'toss-subject'
// event). That channel was built for toss-render and is not toss-specific: it
// already carries a `route` for "a file the renderer could not show as a page,
// so an app is showing it instead", which is exactly a deck slide. Saying it
// makes the sidebar's ref bar, path picker and github menu follow the file the
// reader is swiping through, with no coupling in either direction beyond a
// global and an event.
//
// What the cases hold is the contract between the two, since everything else is
// swipe-deck's (covered in swipe-deck-stack) or fileReview's (in
// file-review-card): the deck pages what the pane is SHOWING, the header names
// the file the reader is on rather than the one they opened at, and a card gets
// its options by reference rather than through an x-data expression.
