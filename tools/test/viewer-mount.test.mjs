// alpineComponents/viewer.js — WHAT show() PROMISES, held behaviourally rather
// than by reading the source for an `await`.
//
// A mode module's `after()` is its async mount: it fetches, loads its library,
// parses, draws, and publishes what it publishes on `root`. switchMode used to
// fire it into a $nextTick and drop the promise, so show() resolved before
// after() had been CALLED and a host had nothing to wait on. Five polls grew in
// that gap, three of them for one workbook's sheet list.
//
// Driven through a probe module with no `assets`, so prepare() short-circuits
// and nothing touches a CDN (the trick viewer-host-modules.test.mjs uses). The
// probe's mount is a promise this file resolves by hand, which is what makes
// "did not resolve YET" assertable at all: a real module would race the test.
//
// The workbook half stubs `window.xlsxKit`. readZip is xlsx.test.mjs's subject
// and re-reading a zip here would only move the failure; what is under test is
// the order the module draws in, and the stub is the smallest thing that lets
// the real after() run to its end.
