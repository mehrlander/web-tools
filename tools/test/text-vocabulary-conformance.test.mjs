// This repo's own prose field names are ones the vocabulary states.
//
// text-fields-registry.test.mjs holds the vocabulary's shape; this holds the
// repo to it. The two fail differently and both matter: one catches a
// vocabulary that has stopped being coherent, this catches a data file that has
// grown a name nobody has accounted for.
//
// Only the UNCLAIMED class is gated, which is the same posture dead-links.py
// takes with its internal class. An alias passes: the vocabulary states what
// the old name means, so a file using it conforms by declaration, and gating
// on aliases would turn every existing file red with a rename across the
// estate as the only route back to green. That is the cost `instead_of` exists
// to avoid.
//
// A failure here is not automatically a mistake. Sometimes a file really has
// found a kind the set lacks, which is how `payload` was added: a tracker
// assessment's `prompt` column holds a session instruction, so the row exists to
// carry the text rather than to describe something else it holds, and no
// existing name meant that. The fix is then a thirteenth name and a moved count
// in the registry test, not an alias to something it is not.
