// A userscript stub, its bookmarklet twin and the body they load are generated
// together by scripts/userscript-stub.py, and two of the three are the kind of
// artifact nobody re-reads. The failures they invite:
//
//   - The stub re-pinned and the bookmarklet left behind, so two routes claim
//     to run one body and run different ones, silently.
//   - A body edited without re-stamping, so the launcher reports a build id
//     that was true yesterday. That is worse than no id: an unlooked-up answer
//     reading as a good one is the failure the stamp exists to prevent.
//   - The published manifest disagreeing with the body, which would make an
//     up-to-date launcher announce that it is behind, or a stale one keep
//     quiet. The manifest is the one thing a reader on the phone cannot check
//     for themselves, so it is the one that most needs checking here.
//
// The pin is deliberately a BRANCH here, which an earlier version of this file
// refused. A commit pin made every edit a reinstall on the phone, and the
// install is the one step that costs a person something. The stamp is what
// makes the branch pin safe to read.
