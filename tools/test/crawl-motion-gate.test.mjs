// The gate on each crawl, and the promise the State view used to print over it.
//
// This file replaces state-view-throttles.test.mjs, which held a different
// invariant for a different design. There were three intervals, one per cache,
// owned by the shell that enforced them, and the State view printed each one on
// its row as "auto every 30m". That test existed because the view kept its own
// copy of each number and the copy was the half that aged.
//
// Both sides of that are gone. The view prints no interval, because there is no
// schedule to name: nothing here has ever run on a timer, and the intervals were
// floors with a promise written on them. Each crawl now gates itself per unit of
// work on whether its source moved, which is evidence rather than a guess, and
// what remains of the clock is one shared debounce nothing renders.
//
// The gates are read out of source rather than executed, for the same reason
// activity-watermark-gate.test.mjs reads its own: they live in the shell's
// inline script and need a live GitHub to run. What can be held here is the
// SHAPE, and the shape is where the bugs are. Every clause below is a way a gate
// could be wrong that would look right on screen, and the worst of them fail by
// serving stale data rather than by throwing.
//
// No network, no pixels.
