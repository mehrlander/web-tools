// kits/session-export.js — the outline, and what a row does not do.
//
// This list ran a selection MODE until 2026-09-06: a pick control on every row,
// a "Pick all / Clear" bar above them, and an export bar below carrying seven
// render toggles, a Preview pane, a live size readout, Download and Copy. The
// invariant those tests guarded was that three doors into one boolean (a tap, a
// bulk chip, and `startCard`) reach the same state, which is where a DOM-held
// flag drifts from the set that decides the output.
//
// A per-row copy button replaced all of it and lasted one commit, on the report
// that a control per item for a thing a reader would not do here is the same
// objection one size smaller. There is no copy control now, so the tests that
// were about picking and copying are the two absence gates below: nothing
// operates the list, and nothing on a row writes to a clipboard.
//
// What is left is a reading surface, and the rest of this file is about the row
// and the panel.
//
// jsdom with no Alpine: this is a DOM-rendering kit and its element is the
// whole product, so the assertions read the element rather than an internal.
