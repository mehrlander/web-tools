// alpineComponents/branch-brief.js — saying WHICH document is being read.
//
// The branch page's strip holds several documents and which one is showing is
// chosen inside the page, not by its address. The sidebar's layer strip walks
// the live frame stack, and a markdown panel is a div in this document rather
// than a frame, so that walk names the page and stops one level short of the
// reader. The container closes the gap by announcing on the subject channel,
// the same one the file deck speaks, with the same route: 'deck'.
//
// The payoff is the sidebar's compare bar, which is gated on a subject having
// announced a BASE. Until this landed the page mounted reading cards that each
// subscribe to the answer on web-tools:compare-ref while the one control that
// publishes it stayed hidden.
//
// The kit is loaded THROUGH gh.load rather than pre-installed on the window, so
// the lazy chain the page actually runs is what is under test.
