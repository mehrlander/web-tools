// The docked deck gives the width back when it closes.
//
//   node tools/test/deck-dock-reflow.mjs
//
// Two facts drive the dock's reflow and they have different lifetimes, which is
// the whole content of this check. `data-deck-pane="dock"` is the reader's
// standing PREFERENCE: it is stored, and it should outlive any one deck, since
// someone who wants the list beside the file wants it on the next file too.
// `data-deck-open` is the deck's LIFETIME, which only the kit knows.
//
// Keying `main`'s padding-right on the preference alone (PR #462, fixed
// 2026-08-20) left the app squeezed by the width of a deck that was no longer
// there: on every view, since main is shared, and across reloads, since the
// preference is in localStorage. It reads as a rendering bug with no bad frame
// to catch, because nothing is animating and the deck is gone.
//
// So the assertion is a sequence rather than a state: padded while open and
// docked, ZERO once closed, and the preference still recorded either way.
//
// Exits nonzero on any failure. Not part of `npm test` (needs a browser).
