// kits/swipe-deck.js — stacking, and the drill that rests on it.
//
// A deck opened from inside a deck is how drilling works: the child covers the
// parent, the header becomes the child's, and leaving the child returns you to
// the parent at the slide you left it on. That is a navigation stack, not
// visible nesting, and it is the shape chosen over a nested pager (the outer
// axis has no meaning at the inner position: files are not aligned across
// branches) and over a level picker (a mode has to be remembered; a place has a
// back button).
//
// Two things made it impossible until 2026-08-13, both found by opening one
// deck inside another in a real browser and driving it. Every deck registered
// its own `popstate`, so one Back closed the whole stack, which is the return
// path itself. And every deck registered its own `keydown`, so one ArrowRight
// stepped the child AND the parent underneath it, landing the reader on a slide
// they never chose with nothing on screen saying so.
//
// Both are one mistake, a deck assuming it is alone, and the cases below are
// the guard: only the top of the stack answers.
