// show-repo's app-wide intake gestures: the window drop (PR #443) and the
// window paste beside it. Both shipped as shell code with their coverage in
// stage.test.mjs, which holds the FOLD (what an arriving thing becomes) and
// says nothing about the GESTURE (which events are taken, which are declined,

// file tests the half the intake tests deliberately do not reach.

// The shell is not a lib module, so it runs through makeShell. `win` is the

// callable here: wireAppDrop/wireAppPaste hand them to window.addEventListener
