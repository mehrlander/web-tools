// lib/kits/chat-render.js — dense mode: the same turn read as a LOG rather than
// as a page of cards, which is what the estate's session card mounts.
//
// Origin: the card renders a whole conversation in a hover panel, and at full
// density every turn spent a line on chrome before it said anything. Measured
// 2026-08-28 over the eight-turn fixture in tools/render/scenarios/
// estate-sessions.mjs: 119 pixels a turn before, 82 after, on identical text.
//
// The three moves are asserted here because each one can fail SILENTLY into
// something that still looks fine: a lead-in that lands in the wrong block, a
// dropped-characters chip that vanishes rather than falling back, an assistant
// turn that loses its indent and reads as an equal.
