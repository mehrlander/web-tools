// show-repo's view routing: the address a screen mints must be an address the
// page can open.
//
// The shell used to state its view table THREE times, by hand: the dispatch
// chain in init(), the dispatch chain in restoreFromUrl() (the popstate
// mirror), and the stamp chain in deepLinkParams(). Nothing held them in step,
// and all three ways of drifting had happened at once (measured 2026-08-11, by
// walking every ?view= param through the real page in headless Chromium):
//
//   ?view=pages      stamped and restorable, missing from init: a link copied
//                    out of the Pages view cold-loaded onto the repo landing.
//   ?view=proposals  dispatched by both chains, stamped by neither: the view
//                    opened, then erased its own address on the first sync.
//   ?view=estate     stamped only beside a repo/ref param, on a premise that
//                    had expired (see the comment at that row).
//
// The three chains are now one VIEWS table, so that class of drift is
// structural rather than a thing to remember. This holds the collapse in place
// (nothing may route around the table) and then round-trips every row through
// the real stamp and the real parse, which is the property the table is FOR
// and which the table alone does not prove.
