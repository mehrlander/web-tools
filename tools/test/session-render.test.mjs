// lib/kits/session-render.js — the record-to-conversation mapping: the merge that
// interleaves three parallel lists, and the grouping the swipe deck pages on.
//
// Loads the real IIFE against a stub window, so these assert the shipped code
// rather than a transcription of it. `turns`, `groups` and `describe` are pure;
// only `open`/`deck` touch chatRender or the DOM, so neither is needed here.
//
// The two things worth guarding, both of which pass a naive check:
//
//   The MERGE is by `at` at one-second granularity, and an assistant turn
//   shares its timestamp with the tool calls it issued, since both are read
//   from one transcript message. Sorting on `at` alone leaves that tie to
//   concatenation order, which puts the calls above the sentence introducing
//   them. It looks fine on any fixture whose seconds happen not to collide.
//
//   The GROUPING is one card per exchange, and what makes that readable is
//   the FOLD, in two levels. A run of tool calls plus the short sentence that
//   introduced it ("Now let me render it") is one STEP; a run of adjacent
//   steps is one SEQUENCE. The first version split a card at each prose turn
//   as well, because without any of this a slide carried a hundred expanded
//   tool entries. Every piece is pinned here, since dropping any one brings
//   the slab back in a smaller size: no folding at all is the original slab,
//   folding calls alone leaves the narration between question and answer,
//   folding steps alone leaves seven or eight lines of preparation, and
//   folding prose by length alone would swallow the answer itself.
