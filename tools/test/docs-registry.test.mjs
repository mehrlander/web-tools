// docs/docs.csv — the documentation registry: the documents registry. Complete
// by construction: every .md/.json/.csv file under docs/ has exactly one row, so a
// file cannot sit in the folder unaccounted for (the same completeness gate
// build-registry.py runs for budget-drs's data files).
//
// The shared-ownership table used to ride along here as a second `claims`
// block, checked by a shape test at the bottom of this file. It moved to
// docs/owners.json on 2026-08-09, with tools/test/owners-registry.test.mjs as
// its own gate: a registry does not live inside another registry's file, and
// a registry and a curated catalog do not want the same checks.
