// The four ideas ported from the prototype at dump/2026-08-08-paste.html are
// TEXT rules, not speech ones, so they test without a microphone: a stub
// SpeechRecognition lets the test play the part of the engine and assert what
// lands in the buffer. That is the whole reason the engine is a kit and not a
// closure inside the annotator, and these tests moved here with it on
// 2026-08-09 (from annotate.test.mjs, where they had to stand up a jsdom
// document and enable an annotator to reach the engine at all).
//
// What is NOT here: that the annotator wires this kit up correctly, and that
// it degrades to no microphone when the kit is absent. Both are seam facts
// and stay in annotate.test.mjs.
