// The deck door has one owner, and the copies are held to it.
//
// swipeDeck.entry() is the estate's affordance for "this collection has a
// reader": one glyph, one wording, one hit target. Its plain consumers call it
// and get that for free. The TEMPLATE-DRIVEN ones cannot: an Alpine template
// with its own x-show, :disabled and busy spinner has to spell the button out,
// and the kit loads on demand, so it is not on the page when that template
// first renders. A host that waited for it would paint no button at all.
//
// So each of those keeps a literal, and this is what stops the literals
// drifting. It is the same shape the surfacing manifest uses against
// SURFACING.md: a copy that cannot be eliminated is held two-way by test
// instead. If someone restyles the door in the kit, this fails and names every
// file that has to follow.
//
// There are seven copies as of 2026-09-04. branch-brief's is the door into a
// branch's FILES; session-brief's is the door into a session's CARDS, and it
// exists because that view was lifted out of pages/session.html to be mounted
// per slide in the Sessions pane; search-view's is the door into the FILES a
// search just found. The Map view's four arrived last: the Surfacing tab's
// pair (the doc and its gated index), and the Docs, Tests and Harness tabs over
// the list each is showing. An eighth joins the table below and needs no other
// change here, which is the point of the table.
//
// `pending` is the one thing a row can decline. Two of the doors render before
// their collection has been counted (a branch whose compare has not been read,
// a session whose cards have not been fetched) and so need the uncounted
// wording as well; the other three only ever render over a list already in
// hand, so requiring that string would be requiring a literal nothing can
// display.
//
// `tone` is the second. It is the host's judgment, not the kit's, and the kit
// says so: primary where the deck is what most readers came to do, ghost where
// it is one lens among several. The Map view's headers are strips of quiet
// chips over cards that are the subject, so both of its doors are ghost. The
// column exists so the check reads each door against the tone it declares
// rather than against the default.
