// text-fields-registry.test.mjs — holds docs/text-fields.csv, the estate's
// vocabulary of prose field names, to the properties it claims for itself.
//
// The vocabulary exists because 65 distinct field names were carrying what is
// broadly a dozen concepts, 80% of them in exactly one file, so nothing
// could ask the estate for its authored rationale and get an answer
// (docs/text-content.md). Two things then have to stay true, and neither is
// obvious from reading the file:
//
//   The alias map has to be a FUNCTION. One old name maps to one new name, or
//   the scan's arrow lies: `scripts/text-carriers.py` resolves an
//   off-vocabulary name through `instead_of`, and a name listed under two
//   fields would resolve to whichever row it read last.
//
//   An alias may not also be a sanctioned name, or a file using it is
//   simultaneously conformant and deprecated. `load_vocab` already skips such
//   an alias, so the collision would be silent rather than wrong: the failure
//   this catches is a vocabulary that quietly means less than it says.
//
// The row count is asserted for the same reason properties-registry.test.mjs
// asserts its ungoverned count. A vocabulary that admits a new name whenever a
// file uses one is not a vocabulary, so the number moves deliberately or
// not at all.
