// The derived fields of docs/docs.csv: `reach` (who can get to a document)
// and `words` (how much of the folder it is). Both are computed from disk
// rather than declared by hand, both are restamped by `npm run docs-reach`,
// and both are gated by docs-registry.test.mjs.
//
// One module and one npm script for two fields, because both write the same
// file: two writers would race on key order and on each other's output. The
// script name predates `words` and is kept, since renaming it would ripple
// through the commit hook, package.json, and CLAUDE.md for no gain.
//
// The documents registry in docs/docs.csv says what each doc IS and how it is
// kept true. Neither answers the question that decides whether a doc does any
// work: can anyone reach it. Measured 2026-07-30 by hand, 22 of the folder's
// markdown files were reachable only by a session that already knew they
// existed, and that number lived in a tracker task where it aged silently.
// This module makes it a derived field, so it is recomputed on every test run
// and cannot drift from the estate.
//
// Five channels, strongest first. A doc gets the strongest that reaches it:
//
//   injected  arrives in every session's context unasked (the session-start
//             hook fetches these two, and CLAUDE.md @-imports them). The
//             strongest channel there is, and the reason these two are the
//             only docs a session can be assumed to have read.
//   project   named by a document that is ALREADY in every session's context:
//             the repo's own CLAUDE.md, or either of the injected two. One hop
//             from every session with no invocation required, so it outranks a
//             skill. Added 2026-08-05, after the first cut reported as orphan
//             four docs that CLAUDE.md names by path: the orphan count was
//             pessimistic, and a count that overstates the problem is corrected
//             for the same reason one that understates it is.
//
//             Widened later the same day to include the injected pair, which
//             the first cut had as sources of nothing. That was incoherent: a
//             link from SURFACING.md is read by every session in every repo
//             that installs the set, which is a wider audience than CLAUDE.md
//             reaches, yet it counted for less than a skill mention. The key
//             stays `project` rather than becoming `context`; the value is
//             stamped into a registry other files quote, and the rename buys
//             accuracy in one word at the cost of churn in several.
//   skill     a skill names the path, so invoking that skill pulls the doc.
//             One deliberate act away, and the act is one an agent takes.
//   app       lib/ or pages/ names the path in CODE, so a page reads it at
//             runtime or opens it in the viewer. This channel was invisible
//             until the derivation was written: six docs are reached only this
//             way, all of them manifests the Map view and the Tools view load.
//             A registry that cannot see it cannot show what that work bought.
//   orphan    nothing points here. Not necessarily dead: docs/README.md
//             indexes the whole folder, so an orphan is reachable by someone
//             already browsing docs/. It means no automated channel puts the
//             doc in front of anyone who is not already looking at it.
//
// Precedence is by strength, not by preference: a doc reached both by a skill
// and by the app records `skill`, since that is the channel more likely to
// deliver it to the reader who needs it.
//
// The corpora are deliberately narrow. tools/ is excluded: a doc named only by
// a build script or a test is exercised, not read, and counting that would
// report the schemas below as reached when nothing loads them.
//
// ── words ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Reach counts files; `words` weighs them, and the two disagree. Measured
// 2026-08-05: the 17 orphans are 40% of the folder's files but 16.7% of its
// words, while docs/show-repo.md alone is 22%. A tab that could filter to the
// orphans in one tap and could not show that split was answering the smaller
// question loudly. Bloat and unreachability are different failures, and a
// registry that carries only one of them will keep pointing at the tail.
//
// Whitespace-delimited tokens of the file as it sits on disk, markdown and
// JSON alike. Crude on purpose: a prose-aware count would need a parser per
// format, and the field only has to support "which of these is large," which
// survives the crudeness. Frontmatter, code fences, and JSON punctuation are
// all counted, so a schema's number is not comparable to an essay's.
//
// The registry describes itself, so stamping the field changes the file being
// measured: writing 42 words values adds 84 tokens to the registry, and its
// own row would be stale the moment it was written. The stamp therefore runs
// to a fixpoint. It converges in two passes, because the digits of a value do
// not change the token count, and it asserts convergence rather than assuming
// it: a derivation that silently failed to settle would produce a file that
// fails its own test on every other run.

// Run it directly (`npm run docs-reach`) to restamp docs/docs.csv after adding
// a doc, pointing a skill or page at one, or editing any doc's length. Both
// fields are cached copies of the derivation, held to it by
// docs-registry.test.mjs.

// everything to the next `*/`, hundreds of code lines, so paths named in that
// span read as unreferenced. One pass fixes it by leftmost-match: the `//`
// sits earlier on its line than the `/*` it contains, so the line branch
// consumes it before the block branch can start. The `[^:]` guard keeps a
// URL's `//` from reading as a comment, as before.
