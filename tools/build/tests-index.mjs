// The derived half of docs/tests.csv, the test registry.
//
// The suite reports a pass count and nothing else, and a pass count is the
// weakest thing it knows. "1,098 pass" says nothing about what is being
// checked, how, or whether any of it would catch a real break. This module
// derives the part a machine can see, so the registry only has to author the
// part it cannot: what each file is FOR.
//
// Derived here, never authored:
//
//   assertions  the number of top-level test() calls written in the file.
//               Static, and a LOWER BOUND rather than the runner's figure: a
//               test() inside a loop is one call here and N tests at runtime.
//               Four files parameterize theirs, so `npm test` reports more
//               than this column sums to. The header used to claim the two
//               could be checked against each other; nothing did, and they
//               never matched.
//   assertion_names
//               what each of those calls is named, in source order. The names
//               are already read to count them and were being thrown away.
//               They are the file's own account of what it checks, authored
//               with the test and updated with it, so the registry does not
//               have to restate coverage in `protects` and cannot go stale
//               against the file the way a hand-written summary does. A
//               parameterized name is carried as its template text, `${...}`
//               and all, which is how a reader can tell one row stands for
//               several runtime tests.
//   method      how a test reaches its subject, which is the axis that
//               decides how much a pass is worth:
//                 kit     loads a lib/kits/*.js through the bootstrap and
//                         exercises its surface in the Node realm
//                 alpine  boots the component in jsdom and drives it
//                 spawn   runs a CLI script as a process and reads its output
//                 read    reads a file and asserts on its content
//                 pure    imports a function and calls it, nothing else
//               A file usually has several; the strongest present wins, in
//               that order, because that is the one carrying the real weight.
//   runner      `suite` for a *.test.mjs file, which `npm test` globs, or the
//               npm script that runs it. The browser-driven checks are named
//               without `.test.` on purpose, so the CI runner never installs a
//               browser; that convention is invisible from the pass count and
//               is exactly what this field makes visible.
//   boot_smoke  WHICH of the file's assertions only check that a component
//               mounts without warnings, as indices into assertion_names. Not a
//               criticism: a boot check catches real breakage cheaply. But it
//               is the lowest-information assertion in the suite, and a file
//               that is mostly boot smoke is claiming less than its count
//               suggests. Indices rather than a count because the property is
//               per assertion, so the count is an aggregate and a consumer that
//               wants one can take the length.
//
// Authored in the registry, because no derivation can supply it: `kind` (what
// genre of check this is) and `protects` (the one thing that breaks if it is
// deleted). `protects` is held to the same standard as the documents registry's
// `maintenance`: a row that cannot say what it protects is a test nobody has
// examined, and the gate counts those rather than banning them.
//
// `protects` and `assertion_names` answer different questions, and the split is
// why deriving the names does not make the authored field redundant. The names
// say WHAT the file asserts; `protects` says what BREAKS if it goes, which for
// a gate is not recoverable from any test name. What the names do
// retire is the inventory: `protects` had been absorbing coverage lists because
// coverage was invisible in the view, and twelve rows had grown past 300
// characters restating what the file already said better. One sentence here,
// the list derived beside it.
//
// Run `npm run tests-index` to restamp after adding or changing a test.
