//   node tools/build/snags-index.mjs [--check]
//
// The log's own rule is that recurrence is the signal: an entry tracks how
// often it bit, and the third sighting earns a tracker task. That rule needs
// two things nothing was supplying.
//
// FIRST, the set has to be visible at the moment of appending. A session that
// trips over something opens this file, reads the header, and writes a new
// entry at the top; it does not read 400 lines of entries first. So the index
// sits between the header and the newest entry, in the one place the append
// path already passes through, sorted by sighting count so the repeat
// offenders lead and the "third time earns a task" line has something to point
// at.
//
// SECOND, a near-repeat has to be caught mechanically, because a session that
// knew the entry existed would have edited it instead. Measured 2026-08-14:
// one session wrote `headless-prose-unstyled` for a trip `headless-shot-prose-flat`
// already owned, and the collision surfaced days later as a merge conflict.
// Slug equality would not have caught that; shared TOKENS would ("headless",
// "prose"). So the generator reports every pair of entries sharing two or more
// significant slug tokens, as a warning printed at commit time, when the entry
// is being written and can still be folded into the one that exists.
//
// The warning does NOT fail the run, here or under --check. Overlap is a
// heuristic: `headless-shot-prose-flat` and `headless-prose-unstyled` really
// are the same snag, while two genuinely different loader snags would both
// carry "loader" and be fine. A gate on a guess teaches people to route around
// it. This reports, and a human decides, which is the same posture as the
// repo's other scans.
//
// --check compares instead of writing, the idiom every generator here shares,
// so tools/test/derived-artifacts.test.mjs can hold the file to its source.
//
// SECOND ARTIFACT, added 2026-08-26: docs/snags.csv, the derived registry.
// This generator was already reading the log as data; the records simply did
// not survive the run, so nothing could hold the extraction to a schema and
// nothing else could read it. Measured that day: the file held 53 entries and
// the parse saw 46, because seven in the tail still carried the retired
// unslugged heading and were absorbed by the entry above them, and one entry's
// sighting list read `2026-08-19 ×3, one text, one fill, one straggler`, whose
// last three commas the split turned into sightings. The headline count the
// log's own header calls meaningful was the number that was wrong.
//
// So the parse is strict now: a sighting is a DATE, optionally carrying the
// `×N` multiplier the log already writes, and anything else is reported rather
// than counted. An unslugged `##` heading below the index is reported too.
// Neither fails the run, for the reason the repeat warning does not, except
// through the derived-artifacts gate, which fails when the CSV is behind the log.
//
// What stays in the markdown is what a CSV cell is a bad home for: the
// paragraph under each entry naming the criterion, the condition under which
// the trip happens again, which is what makes an entry actionable. The
// registry carries only what is mechanical (slug, one-line title, sightings,
// count, the → targets), the same split docs/docs.csv runs.

// and a bold sub-paragraph inside it is part of it: several entries carry a
// dated correction or a "corrected move" paragraph, and each of those dates is
// another sighting of the SAME snag, which is what the recurrence rule counts.
//
// That boundary is only safe because every block in the file now leads with a
// slug. It did not: until 2026-08-14 the tail held older bold-lead blocks with
// no heading, and a rule this simple absorbed them, reporting
// `screenshot-hides-overflow` as seen fourteen times when it was seen once.
// Eleven of them were migrated rather than parsed around, which is why the
// generator can be this plain.
//
// The guard that replaces the workaround is narrower and aimed at the way an
// entry actually gets added: newest on top, so an unslugged block would land
// between the index and the first heading. Any sighting there is counted as
// orphaned and reported. A block appended with no slug lower down would be
// absorbed by the entry above it, which this cannot see; the header's rule
// that every entry leads with a slug is what keeps that from happening.
// A sighting is a date, optionally carrying the `×N` the log already writes for
// several trips on one day. Nothing else is one: the `, one text, one fill, one
// straggler` that used to sit in a seen list is prose about the sightings, and
