"""The standoff annotation, and the delivery payload that carries it to a page.

Two commands, because they make two different things and only one of them is
the artifact:

  standoff   doc.md + units.jsonl + labels.tsv -> standoff.json
             The annotation itself. It does NOT contain the document. It names
             its target and carries a sha256 of the bytes it was made against,
             so "does this annotation still describe that file" is a question
             with an answer rather than an assumption. This is the durable
             thing; a run directory keeps it beside the two inputs that made it
             so the pass can be re-run rather than only its result surviving.

  payload    doc.md + standoff.json -> audit/1, optionally --inject into a page
             Delivery only. It joins the standoff to a copy of the source so a
             page can render offline, inside a toss, with no fetch. The standoff
             rides VERBATIM under its own key: what the page shows in its
             Standoff view is the committed file, not a re-derivation of it.

# THE LABELS ARE DATA. A vocabulary is a TSV of label / side / gloss, with an
# optional color column (an "r,g,b" string the page paints with). The default
# is doc-craft's binding question; --vocab names any other, and --question says
# what that vocabulary asks. check.py never reads the label column, so nothing
# downstream branches on which vocabulary a run used.
#
# A LABEL AND A REMOVE MARKER, BOTH DECLARED. `vocabulary` says what a unit
# IS; `verdicts` is KEEP or DROP, whether it stays. labels.tsv seeds both and
# owns neither: the pass writes it, the builder copies it in, and from then on
# the standoff is the live one, because an edit in the page lands there.
