// docs/registries.csv is one row per registry; docs/properties.csv is one row
// per column of one registry. They were a single docs/properties.json until
// 2026-08-16, whose two tables plus a 544-word prose note lived in one file.
// CSV is the format because it cannot hold two tables: that is what makes "a
// registry is a file" true by construction rather than by convention, and it is
// what retired `carrier`, `rows` and `format` in one move.
//
// `path` replaces all three, and it is now a plain file path. It briefly also
// took a `#fragment` naming the key that held the rows, which every JSON
// registry needed and thirteen of twenty-one carried; that was `rows`' old job
// under a new name. It went when the last JSON registry became a CSV on
// 2026-08-18, because a CSV's file IS its table. `file` survives as an alias of
// `path` so consumers written against the split still read.
