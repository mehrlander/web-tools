// The point is what 2026-08-14 changed. A declared `landing` used to TAKE the
// front door: opening the repo rendered that page and the README was reachable
// only by leaving. Now the landing is a row of its own and Overview leads with
// the README for every repo, so the two coexist instead of one displacing the
// other. That is a claim about a state the estate cannot currently reach, since
// `repoLandingView` is null for every repo that exists; unit tests cover the
// getter, and this is the only thing that renders it.
//
// The sandbox has neither a token nor the private registry, so the manifest is
// written onto the store directly. Nothing else is stubbed: the sidebar rows
// are pure getters over it, and the Overview body is the real overview()
// component reading this repo through the contents-API shim.
