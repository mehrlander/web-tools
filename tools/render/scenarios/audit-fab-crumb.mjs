// Safari's "A problem repeatedly occurred" is the web process dying, so no
// handler on the page runs and the health readout stays green about a tab that
// is gone. The fab writes each stage of a tap to localStorage before entering
// it (alpineComponents/fab.js, _crumb) and drops the trail when the tap
// completes; the page reads a leftover key on boot and reports it.
//
// A real crash cannot be provoked headless, so this simulates one: write the
// key exactly as _crumb writes it, reload, and assert the readout names the
// stage. Then tap the fab for real and assert a completed tap leaves no key,
// which is the half that stops the instrument crying wolf on every load.
