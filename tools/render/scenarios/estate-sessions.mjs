// Drive show-repo's estate into the Sessions pane and the Lists pane with

// The sandbox has no token and no network, so the estate's real loads all fail
// and every authed pane collapses to its "set a token" line. This stubs the one
// thing those panes read (the component's own state) after Alpine has mounted,
// which is enough to render the layout truthfully: the markup, the classes, and
// the scroll containers are the page's, only the data is ours.

// CARD=turns|tools|files|tokens opens that pair's card on the first row. Those
// four numbers said what they counted only in a title, so the card is the only
// way a phone reader learns that 206 is tool calls and which tools they were.
// CARD=reply opens the ask line's card, which renders the session as a
// transcript through kits/chat-render.js and so needs the network the other
// four do not.
// CARDTOP=1 scrolls that card back to its first entry (it opens at the last).
// STALE=1 puts the first row a summarizer version behind.
//
// LIVE=1 replaces the first row's hand-written prose with a lean row plus a
// stubbed record (TURNS_RECORD below), so the card runs the real path: the
// summarizer heads the turns, the header numbers them off their own instants,
// and a tap has a record to open the deck against. Anything about TRUNCATION,
// the header's clock or the rail's placement has to be shot this way: a
// hand-written row carries a UTC clock string and no instants, so its rail
// falls back to even spacing and its clock to the string. With it:
//   TAP=<n>      taps the nth turn (1-based), which opens the session deck on
//                that exchange; the card stays open underneath it
//   SCROLL=<px>  scrolls the card down that far, for the header's position

It cannot tell you whether the reader will read the resulting link as a claim about something the link does not actually show, which is what the honesty gate is about. So the rule stays a sentence, and the sentence is short enough to survive being read.\n\n🟡 **Pending:** the Map view needs the CSV to exist before the tab can read it, and the CSV is still being derived from the prose.' },

So the honest shape is one column for reach and one for the named exception, and the exception is empty for the mechanisms that have none.' },
