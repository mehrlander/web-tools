"""Emit dump/2026-08-28-question-margin.html.

One reply, paragraph by paragraph, with the question each paragraph answers in
the margin. The reply is the real 3,012-character wrap-up from session
d0aaedcc, chosen because we know what it cost: its fifth paragraph discloses a
defect nobody fixed, and it went unread for 12h37m until the user re-read the
reply by hand. So this is a test with a known answer.

Text is read from the record; the questions are authored.

# answer where the question is yes-or-no, names its own subject rather than
# inheriting one from the question, and carries the fact rather than a label
# for the fact. "both, in that order" fails all three and reads as coy.
# Short is fine where the fact is short; vague is never fine.
