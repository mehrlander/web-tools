"""Inventory the carriers that already hold authored text, and how organized they are.

The companion to scripts/embedded-prose.py, which finds text with no carrier. This
one looks at the text that DID make it into a data file and asks whether the
carrier is in any shape to be relied on.

A **prose field** is a CSV column or a JSON key whose values are sentences
rather than codes, ids, paths, or labels. The script finds them all, then
reports three things about each:

    declared    does anything in the repo name this carrier file: a registry,
                a README, CLAUDE.md, any .md. Undeclared means the text is
                filed but not accounted for.
    supplied    is it quoted source material (under a data/source/ tree or so
                declared in content.csv) rather than something written here.
                Supplied text is not the estate's voice and mostly should not
                move.
    field name  what the column is called.

The field-name tally is the point of the run. One concept called `note` in one
carrier, `comment` in the next, `rationale` in a third and `why` in a fourth is
not a naming quibble: it means no reader and no tool can ask "show me the
authored rationale in this repo" and get an answer. A vocabulary that has never
been stated is the honest measure of how organized the carriers are.

Advisory and heuristic, like scripts/embedded-prose.py: it WILL surface false
positives, and it exits 0 unless --check is given.

Portable: python3 stdlib only, argv-driven, runs from any repo root.

Usage:
    python3 text-carriers.py [ROOT] [prefix ...] [options]

    --markdown   also read GFM tables in .md as carriers. Their headers report as
                 `label` and are never gated: a table header is a phrase for a
                 reader, not a field name a tool reads
    --fields     the field-name tally: every prose field name, with how many
                 carriers use it and how much text it holds
    --carriers   one row per carrier file
    --undeclared only carriers nothing in the repo names
    --csv        emit rows as CSV
    --min N      a field is prose-bearing at N+ qualifying cells (default 3)
    --vocab P    path to the field vocabulary (default docs/text-fields.csv)
    --offvocab   only the field names that are not in the vocabulary
    --check      exit 1 if any authored carrier is undeclared, or any prose
                 field name is one the vocabulary does not account for. An
                 alias passes: it conforms by declaration, not by rename.
