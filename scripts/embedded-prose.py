"""Report the authored natural-language text living inside code files.

Prose in a `.js` or `.html` file has no carrier and no registry row, so nothing
counts it, nothing renders it, and nothing notices when it goes stale. This
script counts it, in three classes that want three different answers:

    commentary   a comment block: rationale addressed to whoever edits the file.
                 Legitimate in principle. The question is only ever SIZE, since
                 past a few hundred words a comment is a design document that
                 happens to live in a source file.

    text-table   an object literal whose values are prose, keyed by something:
                 `{ "Salaries": "DRS staff pay. The open checkbook never ..." }`.
                 This is CONTENT, not code. It wants a CSV or JSON carrier with
                 a declared authorship, so a non-editor can read and revise it.

    inline       reader-facing sentences hardcoded in markup or a template
                 literal rather than read from a data file.

None of the three is an error and the script never says it is. A comment is
supposed to exist; a two-row gloss table is not worth a CSV. What the run makes
visible is the shape of the estate's undeclared prose: which files carry a
document, which content has no carrier, and how much text ships to the browser
on every load.

Advisory, in the idiom of scripts/unclaimed-code.py and the internal
class of scripts/dead-links.py: heuristic, WILL surface false positives, and
exits 0 unless --check is given a budget to hold.

Portable: python3 stdlib only, argv-driven, runs from any repo root.

Scope it. Unscoped it walks every tracked .js and .html, which will include
vendored shelves and generated payloads whose prose is nobody's to move. Pass
the prefixes you maintain.

Usage:
    python3 embedded-prose.py [ROOT] [prefix ...] [options]

    --blocks         list every comment block, largest first
    --tables         list every text table
    --inline         list reader-facing prose found in markup and templates
    --dated          list comment blocks asserting a dated measurement
    --csv            emit rows as CSV instead of the summary table
    --min N          floor for the listings (default 40 words)
    --check N        exit 1 if any single comment block exceeds N words
    --weight         add the gzipped transfer cost of the commentary

--dated answers a question the size bands cannot: which comments make a claim
that was true when it was written and has nothing that re-runs it. A block
carrying an ISO date is asserting a measurement at a point in time. Those
carrying a FIGURE beside the date are the ones that go stale silently, because
the figure counts something that keeps moving while the sentence does not, and
they are marked. Advisory, and deliberately not a gate: a dated block is not a
defect, it is a claim someone has to re-check, and the report only says which
claims those are and how old each has become.

Reads .js, .mjs, .html, and .py. Python is in scope because a build script is
where a page's reader-facing strings go to hide: a `blurb` list in a builder
reaches a reader exactly as a `blurb` list in a view module does, and the two
should not be countable by different means.
