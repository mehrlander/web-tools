"""Tailwind opacity modifiers on a daisyUI theme colour that generate no rule.

A class like `bg-primary/25` looks exactly like a class that works, and does
nothing. The failure is silent and, worse, INVERTED: a background falls back to
transparent, so the tint never draws, and text falls back to full strength, so
the thing meant to recede advances. Nothing errors, nothing warns, and on the
machine where the UI was built it simply looks like a taste decision.

THE CONSTRAINT BELOW WAS LIFTED ON 2026-09-16, AND THIS SCAN IS NOW A GUARD
RATHER THAN A LIVE RULE. lib/gh-boot.js registers daisyUI's twenty theme
colours with Tailwind (`@theme inline`, self-referencing var()), which is what a
compiled build gets from `@plugin "daisyui"` and a CDN page never had. With the
names registered, Tailwind composes the opacity itself and EVERY step generates:
re-measured the same way, bg-primary/25, /5 and even /[33%] all paint, as do
hover: and group-hover: forms that generated nothing before.

So the ramp below is no longer the boundary, and the rule this file encodes is
now conservative rather than correct: it flags classes that work. It is kept,
unchanged, because it is cheap and because it fails safe. What it cannot see is
the failure that actually bit, a theme colour with an opacity modifier UNDER A
VARIANT, which is dead without the registration whatever the step; the pattern
matches the colour and the step and never looks left. tools/test/theme-
registration.test.mjs holds the registration to this file's colour list, so the
two cannot drift.

MEASURED, not assumed (2026-08-19, headless Chromium against this app's own
stylesheet, reading getComputedStyle on injected elements):

    bg-primary/10 .. /90 by tens   generate
    bg-primary/0, /5, /25, /33,
      /75, /95, /100               DEAD  -> rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
    bg-primary/[25%]               DEAD  (the bracket escape does not help)
    bg-red-500/<anything>          fine, including /0, /33, /95, /100
    bg-black/<anything>            fine

So the rule is NARROWER than "use tens": it is about daisyUI's THEME COLOURS,
which are CSS variables, and the working set is exactly the ramp daisyUI's own
stylesheet ships. A stock palette colour is compiled by the browser build and
takes any step. A scanner written to the looser rule would flag every
`bg-red-500/25` in the tree and be wrong about all of them, which is why the
colour list below is the whole classifier and is pinned by test.

Advisory by default, in the idiom of dead-links.py and stranded-titles.py: run
it, read the list, fix or shrug. `--check` makes it a gate, which is what
tools/test/dead-opacity.test.mjs uses, because unlike a stranded title this one
has no judgment in it: the class either generates or it does not.
