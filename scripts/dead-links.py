"""Report markdown links that no longer resolve, in three classes.

  internal    a link to another file in the same repo
  cross-repo  a relative path that escapes the repo root into a sibling
              checkout (../../budget-wa/...). It never resolves on github.com
              and resolves locally only when that checkout happens to be there
  github      an owner URL at main whose path is gone, in either form:
              github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob|tree/main/... or
              raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/...

The cross-repo class is the one with no owner on either side. A store can
reorganize without knowing who reads it, and the reader finds out only if
someone happens to run something. mehrlander/home held 45 dead links into
mehrlander/budget-wa across two moves of one estate, and ran broken for a day
before an unrelated suite turned it up (2026-08-03). Both repos now run this.

Nothing here is repo-specific: the root is argv, siblings are discovered rather
than listed, and the owner is a flag. One copy serves every caller.

Two findings worth keeping, because both produced confident wrong answers:

  A ref can contain slashes (claude/some-branch-abc123), so a URL cannot be
  split into ref and path without knowing the ref. Only .../main/... is
  checkable, and a link to a branch points at a moving target anyway.

  A shallow checkout cannot answer where a file went: `git log` truncates with
  no error, so every trace reads "never existed". Claude Code web checkouts are
  shallow. Run `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` before concluding a
  target was deleted rather than renamed; see web-tools
  docs/environment/container.md.

Verdicts are ok, dead, or unverifiable. A link into a store with no checkout is
*unverifiable*, never dead: absence of a checkout is not evidence of a bad path,
and a one-repo machine must not fail on it.

Usage:
  python3 dead-links.py [ROOT] [--owner NAME] [--cross-repo] [--check]

  ROOT          repo to scan (default: cwd)
  --owner       GitHub owner whose URLs are checkable (default: mehrlander)
  --cross-repo  report only the cross-repo and github classes
  --check       exit 1 if any cross-repo or github link is dead; implies
                --cross-repo. The internal class is never gated: it turns on
                judgment this cannot supply (a target may have been retired on
                purpose, and repointing would be guessing).

Sibling checkouts resolve by $REPO_NAME (upper, dashes to underscores), then
$REPO_NAME_REPO, then a directory beside ROOT. A bare $HOME is never consulted:
it is the user's home directory, and reading it marks every link into a repo
named "home" dead.
