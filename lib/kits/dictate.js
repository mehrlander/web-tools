// kits/dictate.js — voice input as a plain text buffer: start the engine, speak,
// and read `text` back. A factory over callbacks, with no opinion about where
// the words are going.
//
// Ported from the prototype dropped at dump/2026-08-08-paste.html and extracted
// from kits/annotate.js on 2026-08-09, where it was written as a factory with no
// reference to the annotator precisely so this would be a move rather than a
// rewrite. Four ideas from the prototype are the whole value, and none is about
// speech recognition itself:
//
//   SPOKEN PUNCTUATION IS TEXT, TYPED PUNCTUATION IS PUNCTUATION. Engines
//   guess badly at where a comma goes, so a recognized '.' is rewritten to
//   the word " period" and real marks arrive only from the punctuation row.
//   The guess is removed rather than corrected. The one exception is the
//   sentence-ending period, which this kit writes itself (below): the engine
//   cannot say where a comma goes, but a pause is a full stop often enough
//   that making the reader tap for it every time was the wrong default.
//
//   THE STOP-MARK-RESTART CYCLE. Nothing can be injected into a live
//   recognition stream, so a tapped mark parks itself, stops the engine, and
//   the end handler writes it and starts again.
//
//   CONTINUATION CASING. After a comma or semicolon the next utterance is
//   the same sentence, so its leading capital is lowered. This is what makes
//   stitched fragments read as prose.
//
//   THE KEYBOARD NEVER OPENS. Committed text lands in a plain element, not a
//   focused input, so on a phone the compose surface costs no viewport. That
//   rule belongs to the caller's UI; what this kit owes it is a buffer that
//   never needs an input to be edited.
//
// The prototype carried a fifth idea, a contenteditable with live Range
// bookkeeping, that this deliberately drops: the buffer is a flat string, so an
// insertion point is a cursor into text and the interim can render in its own
// element instead of inside the document being edited.
//
// A THIRD thing arrived on 2026-08-09: a selection the browser does not own,
// so a phone's callout bubble never lands over the text and the composer can
// operate on a range of its own (replace it by speaking, recase it from the
// pad). The model is here; the gestures belong to each surface. See "The
// range" below.
//
// Two things arrived after the extraction, both in the same handler and both
// about what a PAUSE means, which is the only structural signal speech gives:
//
//   THE PAUSE PERIOD. A pause writes a real '.' at the end of the buffer and
//   it stays, so the sentences punctuate themselves as they are spoken rather
//   than one period arriving at the very end. A backspace takes it back where
//   the pause was not an ending, and takes the capital with it.
//
//   THE STITCH, which is what a wrong pause period costs to undo. A pause
//   mid-sentence writes a full stop and the engine capitalizes after it, so
//   the repair is two edits at one seam, and `stitch()` makes them one. It
//   acts on the break the CARET is at, which during dictation is the full stop
//   just written, so the ordinary repair is one tap and no aiming.
//
//   A BREAK IS A FULL STOP WITH TEXT AFTER IT. The stitch also answered for a
//   full stop ENDING the buffer for one commit, and that is what made its
//   target ambiguous: during dictation the buffer almost always ends in the
//   mark the pause just wrote, so the trailing case shadowed every older one.
//   It is gone, and costs nothing, because the BACKSPACE already takes a
//   trailing mark off and sets the same continuation.
//
//   AND `jumpBack()`, WHICH IS HOW THE CARET REACHES AN OLDER BREAK. The
//   newest one needs no aiming; an older one is walked to, so the reader can
//   see which they are about to close. See "The seam" below.
//
//   THE PAUSE RECORD. How long each silence ran is kept beside the segment
//   that followed it, so `paragraphs(ms)` can propose breaks mechanically.
//   The engine already knows where the pauses were; this stops throwing that
//   away, which is the cheap half of a problem a model would otherwise guess
//   at.
//
//   THE ENGINE IS KEPT ALIVE, which arrived on 2026-08-23 and is the reason
//   long-form dictation was not possible before it. `continuous` is a request
//   and WebKit ends a recognition at its own silence timeout regardless, so a
//   reader who paused to think came back to a microphone that had switched
//   itself off without saying so. The kit now holds the reader's INTENT apart
//   from the engine's state and relaunches an end nobody asked for, capped by
//   a dry budget so a muted device cannot become a hot loop. See "Keeping the
//   engine alive" below; `keepAlive: false` opts out.
//
//   Dictate.available(win?)   -> bool, is there a recognizer in that window
//   Dictate.create(opts)      -> a handle (below)
//
// opts: { win, onText, onInterim, onState, onError, now, keepAlive, lang, fix }.
// Every field is optional. `win` is the window holding the recognizer, or a
// function returning it, and defaults to this one: the annotator passes an
// accessor because its target window is a frame's and can change between
// calls. The callbacks default to no-ops, so a caller that only polls `text`
// need pass nothing. `now` is the clock, injectable so a test can drive the
// pause record without waiting out real silences. `keepAlive` defaults to
// true and `relaunchMs` to 120. `lang` overrides the window's own language.
// `fix` is a per-segment rewrite, for a caller carrying a correction list.
//
// The handle:
//   .text          get/set the buffer
//   .listening     does the reader want to be heard (survives a relaunch)
//   .live          is an engine up this instant

//   .available()   is there a recognizer to start
//   .start() .stop() .toggle()

//   .backWord()    delete the last word, or the mark clinging to it
//   .segments      [{text, start, gap}] per finalized segment
//   .paragraphs(ms) the buffer with breaks proposed at the long pauses
//   .range .hasSelection            the selection, {start,end} into the buffer
//   .select(a,b) .selectWordAt(i) .caretAt(i) .clearRange() .moveEdge(w,i)
//   .insert(s) .recase('upper'|'lower'|'title')
//   .stitch() .canStitch    close a sentence break: the caret's, else the newest
//   .stitchAim              which of those it would be: 'caret' / 'back' / ''
//   .stitchSeam             where it would happen, for a marker to paint
//   .jumpBack() .canJumpBack   move the caret to the previous sentence break
//   .unend() .canUnend      take back the full stop the pause just wrote
//   .armCapital(on) .capitalArmed   capitalize the next segment to land

    // here paints a mic reading "Recording. Tap to stop.", and until now that
    // sentence was false.
    //
    // So INTENT is held apart from the engine's state. `wanted` is what the

    // an engine happens to be running this second. An end nobody asked for
    // relaunches. A tapped mark already rode a relaunch of its own (see

    // ── The pause period ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // Every pause writes a real '.' at the end of the buffer, and it STAYS.
    // The reader sees sentences punctuate themselves as they speak, which is
    // what a phone's own dictation does and what this was asked for.
    //
    // It briefly did the opposite, taking the period back when speech resumed
    // on the theory that the pause might have been mid-sentence. Two things
    // retired that (2026-08-09, from use). The buffer it produced carried a
    // single period at the very end and none in between, because each new
    // segment removed the last one: the periods never accumulated, so the
    // draft read as one run-on. And the theory double-counts, because the
    // engine has ALREADY filtered short hesitations: `isFinal` fires at its
    // own end-of-segment detection, and a hesitation too brief to be a
    // sentence break is usually too brief to finalize, so it never reaches
    // here to be judged. The finalization is the pause detector.
    //
    // THE PERIOD AND THE CAPITAL STAY ONE DECISION, which is what the earlier
    // pass got right and this keeps. The period stands, so the engine's
    // capital stands with it and nothing is lowered. Take the period away and
    // the sentence is continuing again, so `backWord()` turns the continuation
    // flag on and the next utterance comes down to lower case. One backspace
    // undoes a pause the reader did not mean as an ending, and undoes it in
    // both respects.
    //
    // The period is MATERIALIZED, written into the buffer rather than derived
    // at read time, so `.text` is the truth for every caller and nothing has
    // to know to punctuate before saving.
    //
    // There is no flag tracking which periods this wrote. There was one while
    // the period could be taken back, and once it stays there is nothing left
    // to distinguish: a period at the end of the buffer behaves the same
    // whether a pause or a thumb put it there, and both `mark()` and
    // `backWord()` treat it that way on purpose. Deleting the flag deleted
    // three of its five call sites outright.

      // most recent invented break is taken, which is the case dictation

      // that break is still the last thing in the buffer there is nothing to
      // join it TO, so the repair is `unend`, which is the same idea one
      // keystroke earlier.

    // THE TEXT MUST NOT MOVE. The first cut of this painted the edit in place,

    // when it came off. A marker that moves the words it is pointing at is
    // worse than no marker, and a reader looking at a preview of an edit cannot
    // tell it from the edit having happened.
    //
    // So the seam is wrapped in a span carrying no style, purely to be
    // measured, and everything visible hangs off its client rect in the layer
    // the pins already use. Wrapping is layout-neutral (an inline span

    //
    // A BADGE ABOVE THE LINE WAS TRIED TWICE AND DOES NOT FIT, and the reason
    // is arithmetic rather than taste. Any icon big enough to read is around
    // 22px; the line box is 34px holding roughly 15px of glyph, so a badge
    // hovering above a seam reaches into the line ABOVE and sits on its words.
    // Flipping below reaches into the line below and does the same. Only a seam
    // on the first line has room, because the layer hangs over the header's
    // white space, and a marker that works on one line out of four is not a
    // marker. Shots of both are what settled it.
