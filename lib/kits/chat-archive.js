// kits/chat-archive.js — the chat archive as a venue of activity, read one
// month at a time.
//
// mehrlander/chat-histories holds 14,844 conversations across three providers.
// Nothing here loads that, and nothing here could: the two annotation layers
// are 1.9 MB and 9.9 MB, and the raw snapshots are hundreds of megabytes. What
// makes a pane over it affordable is that the archive is ALREADY SHARDED at the
// grain a reader wants, one file per month per layer, so paging back a month
// costs two small requests and paging back a year costs nothing until asked.
//
// WHY A VENUE AND NOT A PROJECTION. Branches and Sessions are two readings of
// the repos. This is not: no key joins a chat to a branch or a session, the
// archive's ids are chat uuids while sessions carry harness `session_...` ids,
// and a Claude Code web session is not a claude.ai conversation in the first
// place. So this pane cross-links chat to chat (tags, arcs, searches) and never
// pretends to a join it does not have. It is here because conversation is where
// a share of the thinking happens, not because it can be tied to a commit.
//
// This paragraph also argued from the two corpora not overlapping in time, and
// that half is no longer true: the 2026-08-14 Claude delta covers 2026-07-06
// through 2026-08-14 and the session store begins 2026-07-29, so they overlap
// by about two weeks. The conclusion is unchanged, because overlapping is not
// joining; the sentence went because a reader who checked it would find it
// false and doubt the rest.
//
// THE ONE JOIN THAT DOES EXIST runs the other way and is not this pane's:
// the archive's claude-code-web/ folder holds dated scrapes of the
// claude.ai/code sidebar, which is the only readable source of a session's real
// TITLE, and kits/repo-sessions-cache.js folds it into state/sessions.json on
// `agent_session`. Chats supply titles to sessions; nothing joins a chat to
// one.
//
// WHY THE FRONTIER IS READ, NOT COMPUTED. "How far behind is the archive" is
// answerable only by scanning every month of every provider, which is the one
// thing this file exists to avoid. chat-histories generates the answer instead:
// annotations/catalog/frontier.json, written by tools/catalog_coverage.py
// alongside the coverage report. One number, one owner, and the repo's own
// declared staleness check reads the same file, so the pane and the estate card
// cannot disagree about how stale the archive is.
//
// WHAT THE FRONTIER CANNOT SAY, and every consumer must repeat it: the archive
// knows when it last HEARD, never how much it is missing. The count of
// unarchived conversations is unknowable until the next export lands, and a
// windowed export filters by creation date only, so revivals and deletions are
// invisible to one.
//
// Split like the other kits: pure folds first (unit-tested against fixtures),
// then a cached reader in the shape kits/estate-search.js established, a
// module-level memo with in-flight dedup and a short failure backoff. Attaches
// to window.chatArchive, loaded via gh.load('kits/chat-archive.js').
//
// SEARCH IS SPLIT ACROSS THIS FILE AND THAT ONE, deliberately. `searchSegs` and
// `matches` below say what a row's searchable text IS, because this file owns
// the row shape; EstateSearch.chats walks the month spine through the reader
// here and applies them, because that file owns the estate's search lanes and
// the Files view's mode pills. The Chats pane's own box uses `matches` directly
// over the months it has already loaded, which is the cheap half of the same
// definition.

  // and says which of the three answered.
  //
  // The summary is the field that makes this pass SEMANTIC rather than
  // lexical: it is what a model wrote about the chat, not what was said in it,
  // so a query matches how the chat would be described and not the words it
  // used. That is a different reach from the sessions lane's, which quotes.
