// The `runs` ring: the few facts about a crawl that its output cannot show.
//
// Every derived file under the registry's state/ answers "what is true now",
// and the registry's commit history answers "when did that change". Between
// them sits a small set of facts neither can produce, because they are
// properties of the RUN rather than of the result: how long it took, how much
// it examined to find what it found, and how much of it failed. The app
// computes all three on every crawl, reports them to a four-second toast, and
// drops them.
//
// So each cache file carries a bounded ring of its own recent runs, and the two
// design constraints are what make it cost nothing:
//
//   IT RIDES THE COMMIT THAT ALREADY HAPPENS. A crawl commits only when it
//   found a material change, which is the property that keeps the registry from
//   filling with no-op commits. A run log written on every run would destroy
//   exactly that, and a separate file written beside each cache would double
//   the commits. Appending to the file being written costs nothing extra.
//
//   IT IS INVISIBLE TO THE CHANGE DETECTORS. All three caches decide whether to
//   commit by comparing their record collections (`repos`, `rows`), never the
//   whole document, so a `runs` key can never make a commit happen by itself.
//   That is a property of those three functions, and the reason this must stay
//   a top-level sibling of the records rather than anything nested inside them.
//
// What it therefore CANNOT say, and the State view says so where it renders: a
// run that found nothing leaves no entry, so this counts changes, not runs.
// Buffering the no-op runs locally and flushing them into the next commit was
// considered and dropped: the buffer is per-browser, so a run count assembled
// that way would silently undercount every device that never commits again,
// which is worse than a figure that is plainly absent.
//

  //
  // A field the caller did not measure is DROPPED rather than written as zero.
  // The config crawl swallows a per-repo read failure and cannot count them, so
  // its entries carry no `failed`; writing 0 there would be a claim that none
  // failed, which is a different statement from "not counted" and the one the
