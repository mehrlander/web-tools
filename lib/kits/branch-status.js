//
// The math is pure functions, unit-tested and checked for agreement against the

// each carrying a copy: the branches view (lib/alpineComponents/branches.js) and
// the throttled activity crawl (show-repo's refreshActivityCache, which stores

  //
  //   landed   the bytes at the branch tip are on the default branch now,
  //            either at this path or moved anywhere else in the tree; or the
  //            branch DELETED the path, which strands no content.
  //   differs  the default branch has this path, holding different bytes.
  //            Either the branch's edits never landed, or the default moved on
  //            after they did, and separating those costs a history walk this
  //            scan does not make. So it reports the fact and not a cause.
  //   missing  the default branch has neither this path nor these bytes. The
  //            strong stranded evidence, and the only class that says deleting
  //            the branch would lose something.
  //
  // `differs` went unnamed and uncounted until 2026-08-18, and that is what made
  // the estate row's verdict unreadable: the chip showed `28/80` beside
  // `11 missing`, the two did not add up, and the class holding the other
  // forty-one paths was mentioned nowhere a reader could see. Three counts that
  // sum to the total is the whole fix, and the per-path map underneath is what
  // lets the Files pane show WHICH files rather than only how many.
  //
  // The labels are here rather than in a view because two surfaces render them
  // (the estate row's chip and the branch view's Files pane) and a third could.

  // of them moved. `removed` is neither, since a deleted file is not there to
  // read. All three sum to `n`.
