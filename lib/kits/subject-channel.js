// kits/subject-channel.js — telling the FAB sidebar what you are looking at.
//
// The sidebar already answers "which version of this am I looking at": its
// Render tab names a repo, a ref and a path, roots its path picker there, aims
// its github menu at it, and its ref bar lists the branches carrying a
// different version of that file, one tap to render at any of them. It learns
// all of that from ONE channel, `window.__tossSubject` plus a `toss-subject`
// event, which toss-render stamps per render and the fab adopts.
//
// Nothing about that channel is toss-specific except its name. Any surface
// showing one file at a time can say so on it, and the sidebar follows the
// reader with no coupling in either direction beyond a global and an event.
// The file deck said it first; the stage's reader says it too, which is why
// the machinery is a kit rather than one surface's private code.
//
//   const chan = subjectChannel.open({ bridge: true, keep: ['__deckNavigate'] })
//   chan.announce({ repo, ref, path, route: 'deck' })   // per file
//   chan.set('__deckNavigate', fn)                      // a managed handle
//   chan.openDrawer()                                   // the door, on 'render'
//   chan.release()                                      // on close, once
//
//   bridge   default false. Bridge the sidebar's ANSWER (`__compareRef` plus
//            `web-tools:compare-ref`) down from the shell into this window.
//            Only a surface whose cards read that global needs it; a surface
//            that owns its own comparison, as the stage does, does not.
//   keep     extra globals this surface will overwrite, snapshotted and put
//            back with the subject. `__tossSubject` and `__tossFrame` are
//            always managed.
//
// WHICH WINDOW IS LISTENING is the part that is easy to get wrong, and the
// deck's first version got it wrong. Inside a toss the surface runs in the
// FRAME, and the frame's own fab declined to mount (toss-render stamps
// __fabHosted); the fab that is listening is the SHELL's, one window up. So an
// announcement written only to `window` reached nobody, and the toss link is
// exactly how branch work gets looked at before it merges.
//
// An address-mode toss (#gh=) is same-origin, so the frame can reach the
// parent; a payload toss (#gz=) is opaque and the access throws, which is the
// honest end of it. The host list is therefore every window that might hold a
// fab, this one first.
//
// The frame is nulled beside the subject. A toss subject lives in an iframe and
// the fab reaches into it for Inspect and for the take actions; a slide is in
// THIS document, so there is no frame to hand over and saying so is what keeps
// those features from reaching for one. Every managed global is saved and put
// back on release, since the app can itself be running inside a toss.
//
// THE SNAPSHOT IS TAKEN AT open(), not lazily on first write, and that is the
// one thing this kit fixes rather than merely moves. The deck installs its
// navigate handle before its first announcement, so a channel that remembered
// each window the first time it wrote to it would save the deck's own handle as
// the thing to restore. Ordering stopped being a correctness question the
// moment `open()` reads every managed global up front: the host set cannot grow
// afterwards, since it turns on `__fabHosted`, which toss-render stamps before
// the page boots.
//
// No dependencies. It rides in the pre-build; a page on a gh.load chain names
// it before whatever surface uses it.

    // choice travels the other way on its own channel, read by the cards
    // themselves. In one window that is the whole mechanism and nothing here
    // is needed. This exists for the framed case, the same asymmetry the host
    // list handles above: the fab dispatches on a window the cards are not in,
    // and this surface is the only thing that knows both.
    //
    // One direction only, shell to frame, so there is no loop to guard against
    // beyond the fab never listening for this event.
