// closing-state.js — the conventions' CLOSING STATE, as one vocabulary.
//
// SURFACING.md closes a reply with exactly one state: a marker glyph at the
// start of a line, a bold lead, and the sentences that say what it means here.
// It is the session's own claim about where it arrived, and it is the one thing
// a reader can scan for without opening anything.
//
// This kit exists because that vocabulary was in two places and about to be in
// three. repo-sessions-cache.js owned the pattern and the glyph-to-key table,
// because it was the first to need them; alpineComponents/estate.js owned the
// glyph-to-gloss table, because it was the first to draw one. Each is correct
// about its own half and neither can see the other, so a marker added to the
// conventions would have to be added twice and would be found once. The cache
// kit's own note already argued for this ("One parser, one answer"), so this is
// that argument taken the rest of the way rather than a new opinion.
//
//   marks(md)        the keys a passage closes on, in order, dupes and all
//   closings(md)     the same, each carrying its own text: {key, glyph, text}
//   MARK, GLYPH      glyph <-> key, both directions
//   GLOSS[key]       what the state claims, in the convention's own words
//   HUE[key]         the CSS colour a mark for this state is drawn in
//
// ── The pattern, and why it is this strict ─────────────────────────────────
// Line start and a bold lead, which is what keeps a session that EDITED the
// conventions from reading its own quotation as its state: the vocabulary is
// published as a bulleted list, and a list marker fails this pattern. The
// variation-selector pairs (⚪/⚪️, ✴️/✴, ❇️/❇) are two spellings of one state
// that only a table can settle, which is why the keys exist at all.

  // ── The hues ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // SEVEN OF THESE ARE NOT A CHOICE. The marker IS a coloured disc, so a mark
  // drawn in its hue has for a legend the chat the reader has already read,
  // rather than anything to learn here. That is the same argument estate.js
  // makes for drawing the glyph, and the reason it draws a glyph instead of a
  // colour there does not apply: that row already spends its colour twice, on
  // the outcome rail and the failures fill.
  //
  // THREE ARE, and they are the states whose glyph is not a disc: 🆚, ✴️ and
  // ❇️. Two of those three (choice, needs) are the states that most want finding,
  // so leaving them uncoloured would drop the signal at exactly the moment it
  // matters. They take hues no disc uses, which is the whole constraint: fuchsia
  // is not the purple of 🟣, teal is not the green of 🟢.
  //
  // Literal values, not theme tokens, for the same reason kits/claude-mark.js
  // keeps clay literal: these are the emoji's own colours and they must not
  // move when the theme does. Only `clean` and `done` read the theme, because
  // ⚪ is white on white and ⚫ black on black, and what each has to be is one
  // step off the page in either theme.
