// kits/annotate.js — notes pinned to pieces of a page: select text (or pick an
// element, or drag a rectangle), write a note, and carry the set out as
// markdown for a chat model, as JSON, or as a jot in the estate registry.
//
// The unit is the ANNOTATION SET, not the single note: the point of the kit is
// making several small notes against one document and shipping them together,
// which is what neither a screenshot nor a copied quote does. Five targeting
// modes, one note shape:
//
//   text     the primary case. A selection is anchored as a text quote
//            (exact + prefix/suffix context, the W3C Web Annotation idea),
//            not as node offsets, so the anchor survives re-render and can be
//            re-found in ANOTHER copy of the document (an agent session
//            holding the same file re-finds it by grep).
//   element  a picked node: hover outlines, tap selects. Anchored by a
//            css path and its text excerpt.
//   region   a dragged rectangle in document coordinates, carrying the text
//            of the blocks it covers. The loosest anchor, for "this area".
//   page     no anchor at all: the note is about the page. The serialization
//            already names the document and the address it was read at, so a
//            complaint dictated here arrives knowing where it was taken,
//            which is the whole reason it exists (the alternative was opening
//            another window and typing the address out by hand).
//   section  a part of a rendered markdown document, carrying that section's
//            SOURCE and its line span in the file. The only mode whose body is
//            markdown rather than rendered text. Two ways in, one target
//            builder: kits/md-doc.js's per-heading menu calls noteSection(),
//            and the card's own Section chip runs the pick engine aimed at
//            sections, outlining the whole run a section covers.
//
//            IT IS PICKED, NEVER INFERRED FROM SCROLL, and the Section chip is
//            the only conditional one on the bar, shown where the document
//            holds a declared render. Both decisions were measured; the notes
//            are at startPick and at the chip.
//
// AND THE ADDRESS FOLLOWS THE SOURCE WHERE THERE IS ONE. On a page rendered
// through kits/md-doc.js, every mode's `Path:` line reads
// `docs/APP.md § Mechanism (lines 16-28)` instead of a css path, because the
// render declared what it is a rendering OF. That is the difference between a
// note a model can act on and a note it has to go looking for: a css path
// addresses a DOM that only exists while the page is open, and the file the
// reader wants changed is on disk. Read at the moment the target is built,
// since a deck slide is dropped when the reader swipes two cards away.
//
// A selection is STAGED the moment it ends, and two controls spend that stage:
// the chip that floats beside the text, and the card's own selection bar, which
// carries the words it is about. The bar exists because the chip is where a
// phone puts its own callout, so the one offer was routinely covered or gone.
// Both belong to a card that is already up. With the annotator OFF, the fab
// (alpineComponents/fab.js) makes the same offer above its launcher, since
// 2026-09-08, and takes it by turning this kit on and handing the Range to
// noteSelection(), which reads a passage itself when nothing is staged.
//
// THE STITCH, the repair a dictated note needs most, is a key of its own in
// the composer's bottom row: two taps, the first arming it with a marker in
// the seam and the second committing, with a step-back key beside it. That
// is the shape pages/dictate.html worked out; the composer carried an older
// one, a stitch face in the full-stop cell that showed only with a caret in a
// gap, which left the ordinary case (caret at the end, aim 'back') with no
// key at all. The keys carry the argument.
//
// The set has FOUR readings, and the card carries three of them behind an
// EXPANDER. Collapsed, the card is somewhere to write one note, with the ones
// already filed listed under the composer in whatever room is left. Expanded
// (the count in the header wears a chevron, and is the control) it grows
// UPWARD from its own bottom edge, and the set gets the room: the same list,
// or either serialization exactly as Copy hands it over, of the whole set or
// of the one selected note. Growing up is not a preference: the card is
// anchored bottom-left, a header drag re-anchors it to the TOP, and expanding
// re-pins the bottom edge so the direction cannot depend on whether the card
// has been moved.
//
// The fourth reading is not in the card and cannot be. IN PLACE, the notes are
// drawn ON the page: every one outlined where it is pinned with its words
// beside it, the card folded back to its header strip. A list and the passages
// it describes cannot both be in one screenshot, which is the whole reason for
// it (showInPlace).
//
// Until 2026-08-25 the two serializations and the actions on the set lived
// ONLY in the FAB drawer's Notes tab, so reading a set at all meant a page
// with a drawer on it, and the kit's own surface could not answer "what have I
// got". They are here now, and the single-note serialization is a reading the
// drawer never had. The drawer's copy stands for the moment.
//
// Highlights paint through the CSS Custom Highlight API when the target
// window has it, so the document's DOM is never rewritten: no wrapper spans,
// nothing for a reactive page (Alpine re-renders) to trip over. Where the API
// is absent the notes still collect and serialize; only the paint is skipped.
//
// The kit operates on a TARGET DOCUMENT handed to enable(), defaulting to its
// own. That is what lets the FAB aim it at a toss subject frame (same-origin
// #gh= renders): the kit runs in the shell realm and annotates the subject's
// document, mounting its UI there too. A #gz= sandbox is opaque and cannot be
// annotated, the same boundary Inspect already has.
//
// The composer is the SMALL room for a draft, and kits/dictate-handoff.js is
// the way to the large one (pages/dictate.html). Which room the expand opens
// depends on how much of one there is: past 1024px the far end docks in a
// panel on the right edge and the annotated page stays where it is, below that
// it navigates, because a phone has one screenful and the page it would keep
// would be a strip. See dockDictate.
//
// The composer's voice half is kits/dictate.js, a SOFT dependency read at the
// point of use: chain it before this file and "+ note" opens listening, omit
// it and everything here still works with the microphone simply absent. That
// is why the load is a pair everywhere the annotator is reached (the page's
// gh.load chain, the FAB's _loadAnnotate) and a check everywhere it is used.
//
// Load-time side effect is registration only (window.Annotate); nothing
// touches a DOM until enable(). The pure helpers are exposed with a leading
// underscore for the node test (tools/test/annotate.test.mjs).

  // app on a phone is presented in a sheet the user dismisses by dragging down,
  // and the host decides that from the web view's SCROLL rather than from
  // touches; a handle carrying only touch-action still let the sheet go.
  // Measured on device across five variants, and the negative result is the one
  // worth keeping: touch-action alone dismissed, touch-action plus a cancelled
  // touchmove held, and cancelling touchstart as well also took the text
  // selection and the long-press callout with it. See docs/ios-sheet-drags.md.
  //
  // `{ passive: false }` is not optional: a passive listener cannot cancel
  // anything, and browsers default both events to passive. Nothing is lost by
  // cancelling them, because preventDefault on a TOUCH event suppresses the
  // compatibility MOUSE events rather than the pointer ones, so a pointerdown
  // drag runs exactly as before.
  //
  // It does suppress the compatibility CLICK, though, which is why `skip` is a
  // selector for the clickable children a drag surface may contain: the card's
  // header holds the capture chips, the region cover holds its "+ note".
  // `skip` is a selector for the clickable children, or a PREDICATE where the
  // surface is only sometimes a drag surface: the region cover holds the page
  // still while a rectangle is being drawn and must let it go afterwards, and a

  // WHY THERE HAS TO BE A WAY. The card floats over the thing being described,

  // card has no room for a destination, a repository list, or the words at a
  // length worth reading back, and finding room would mean growing a second
  // copy of controls the dictation page already has. So the card keeps the
  // capture and hands over for the aiming.
  //
  // WHAT RIDES IS TEXT, ALREADY ASSEMBLED. The dictation page is a text buffer
  // and must stay one: teaching it this kit's target model would be a second
  // implementation of something owned here. So the address is resolved into a
  // line HERE, where the aim actually lives, and the far end receives a string
  // it can edit like any other. That editability is the point rather than a
  // side effect: the reason to change rooms is to see the words, and a context
  // line the reader could not delete would be furniture inside their own draft.
  //
  // THE ADDRESS LEADS. A prompt aimed at a coding session wants to open with
  // where to look, and the reader reads the top of the buffer first. Where the
  // page declares a source (kits/md-doc.js, kits/code-doc.js) that is a
  // repo-qualified path; otherwise it is a css selector, which is still the one
  // thing nobody would type by hand.

  // over the wire), which between them are nearly the whole cold cost after
  // that page adopted its build.

  // ── The dock: the far end BESIDE the page, where there is room for both ───
  // The expand navigates, and on a phone that is the only honest answer: the
  // dictation page is a full surface and a phone has one screenful. On a wide
  // viewport the navigation costs more than it buys, because what it leaves
  // behind is the thing being annotated. So past DOCK_MIN the far end opens in
  // the house reader instead, and the page, the card and the notes all stay.
  //
  // THE CONTAINER IS kits/swipe-deck.js, NOT A PANEL OF THIS KIT'S OWN. The
  // first cut here was a bespoke floating panel, which is a second answer to a
  // question the estate had already settled: the deck is the house reader, it
  // is what the app's docs view opens beside its content, and a reader that
  // frames one thing is a deck of one. Taking it brings the whole contract
  // along, none of which this kit would otherwise have: the header and its ✕,
  // a history entry so Back and Escape dismiss, the --deck-top / --deck-left
  // frame so an app's own chrome is not covered, and the pane toggle wherever
  // a host claims one. The deck's own generalization for this is that a deck
  // of one hides its pager.
  //
  // WHAT IT COSTS is the deck's dependencies: it styles itself in Tailwind and
  // daisyUI and marks itself in Phosphor, which every consumer of it already
  // loads and which this kit otherwise refuses to assume (it injects its own
  // icon font and styles itself inline, because it mounts into arbitrary
  // documents). A page carrying neither gets an unstyled reader rather than a
  // broken one, and a page where the kit will not load at all falls back to
  // the navigation, which is what every page did before this.
  //
  // 1024 is the deck's own breakpoint, taken rather than re-derived.
  const DOCK_MIN = 1024;
  // The reader's column. The app clamps the LIST column and gives the deck the
  // rest; here the deck IS the reader and the page is the rest, so the clamp
  // is on this side. Floor first: 20rem is where the far end's four
  // destinations stop wrapping.
  const DOCK_COL = 'clamp(20rem, 32vw, 27rem)';

  // WHOSE PANE IT IS. A host that can dock says so by installing __deckPane
  // (kits/swipe-deck.js, "The host's dock hook"), and that host owns the frame,
  // the reflow and the toggle: show-repo measures its own header and sidebar
  // into --deck-top / --deck-left and reflows `main` out from under the deck.
  // Where one is installed this kit touches none of it and simply opens.
  //
  // Where there is NO host, the kit stands in for one, which is the whole
  // difference between a reader beside the page and a takeover over it. It
  // names the column, expresses `dock` so the deck leaves page scroll alone,
  // and gives the width back on the body so the prose reflows out from under
  // the reader rather than running beneath it. That last part is the one the
  // app's own CSS warns about, and it matters more here than anywhere: the
  // text half-covered by the panel is the text being annotated.
  //
  // Best effort, and the failure is graceful: a page laid out in fixed or
  // absolutely positioned pieces does not reflow, and gets exactly the overlay
  // it would have had. Every value is recorded and put back on close.

  // while kits/swipe-deck.js is document-bound and builds in the shell. The
  // frame has to describe the document the reader is actually in, or the
  // column would be reserved in one document and taken in another.
  // WHAT THE LAUNCHER OCCUPIES, and nothing when there is none. The fab floats
  // 56px at the viewport's bottom-right under a 24px margin, and paints above
  // everything on purpose (alpineComponents/fab.js: a control that owns a
  // surface must sit above it), so a reader reaching the bottom edge wears it
  // over its own controls. Measured at 1280x800: it covered the rightmost
  // button of the far end's destination row outright.
  //
  // A CONSTANT, NOT A MEASUREMENT, because the element to measure is a fixed

  // bottom of the screen. Pinning the bottom edge where it currently sits makes
  // the direction the same either way.

    // there is none. Its behaviour was per-note and its position said per-card,
    // and a reader reading the position was reading it wrong.
    //
    // It is on each note's row now, beside that note's pencil, and on the
    // draft's caption, beside the words it would carry. What follows is the
    // comment that used to justify its place here, kept for its second half:
    //
    // OUT OF THE CARD. See goDictate: the card is where a note is spoken, the
    // dictation page is where it is read back and aimed, and this is the way
    // across.
    //
    // `arrows-out` rather than a chevron, and the reason outlived the chevron
    // it was written against. A caret on this row now means one thing, that the
    // key opens a menu in place (see aimCaret), so a second one meaning
    // open-elsewhere would spend the row's one unambiguous mark twice.
    //
    // HEAD_KEY, like every other key here. It was written with its own border
    // and white ground, which read as a button among keys that have neither,
    // and it is the wider of the two shapes.
    //
    // IT COSTS THE ROW NOTHING, which had to be measured rather than assumed:
    // the row's width was cut deliberately just before this key arrived, and
    // 30px back is the kind of thing that quietly undoes that work. It does not
    // here, because the readings strip beside it FLEXES. Measured 2026-09-08 on
    // the kit's own demo at 320, 360, 390 and 430: one line at every width, and
    // the same 44px header with this key hidden and shown. The strip absorbs
    // the 30px by drawing itself narrower, so what the key spends comes out of
    // slack rather than out of the line.

    // ONE CONTROL, NOT A ROW OF THEM. The aims were a segmented group of four
    // riding the title row, which is four permanent buttons for a choice made
    // once per note and left alone, and it is what pushed the row to the edge
    // of wrapping. A menu says the same thing in the width of one: the button
    // carries the aim in force, the list carries the alternatives, and the
    // alternatives cost nothing until asked for.
    //
    // It also answers the question a row of toggles could not. Arming Element
    // and then changing your mind meant knowing to tap the lit chip again, an
    // exit with nothing on screen naming it. `Page` is the resting position
    // here, so backing out is picking the top item rather than recalling a
    // gesture.
    //
    // THE FACE IS THE GLYPH, NOT THE WORD, and that is a measurement rather
    // than a preference. Arming Element or Section expands the card, which
    // grows this header from three controls to five: at 390px the row carries
    // 380px of content that cannot shrink into 333px of room, and the aim
    // button, the one control a reader is reaching for, falls to a second line.
    // Reported from a phone; measured 2026-09-06 at 320, 360 and 390.
    //
    // The glyph carries the same state, now that the menu behind it teaches the
    // four marks, and it is not silent: the title and the aria-label say the
    // aim in full, and syncChips writes both.
    //
    // 40px BUYS BACK HALF A ROW, NOT A ROW. This button goes 83 to 43;
    // collapsing `Notes 3 ⌄` to its count and chevron is another 48, taking the
    // row's unshrinkable width from 380 to 292. One line at 390 (333 of room)
    // and at 360 (306). At 320 (270) it still wraps, which is the honest

    // inside a declared render, so a tap anywhere else does nothing at all:
    // correct, and silent. Where the markdown IS the page that costs nothing;
    // in a pane inside an app it is the dead-control problem moved from the
    // menu to the canvas, since the row is honest and the region it applies to
    // is unmarked. Measured 2026-08-31: a tap on a block outside the declared
    // box stages no aim, paints no outline and says nothing.
    //
    // ONE MARK AND NO WORDS, because a mode a reader is already inside cannot
    // stop to explain itself. Each section gets a rule down the left of its
    // run, indented by RANK rather than by DOM depth, so the rules nest the way
    // the prose does: the outer section is the longest and leftmost one, and a
    // second tap in the same spot grows the outline to exactly it. That is the
    // gesture made visible rather than described.
    //
    // A DASHED BOUNDARY ROUND THE DECLARED BOX WAS THE OTHER MARK, and it is
    // gone. Where the markdown IS the page, which is every case on a phone, it
    // outlined everything and so said nothing; where the markdown is a panel it
    // said something the rules already say, since a rule only exists where
    // there is markdown. It also had a band of widths where it drew but hugged
    // the screen edge. Redundant with a better mark in the case that matters.
