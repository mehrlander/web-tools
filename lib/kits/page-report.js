// ── page-report: the page files its own bug report ─────────────────────────
//
// A page on a phone can see far more about its own failure than the person
// holding the phone can relay. It knows every fault it caught, what it loaded
// and what that cost, which build it is, and what the browser is. The reader
// knows what fits in a screenshot: one line, cropped and retyped, composed by
// hand under the impression that the interesting part is the part on screen.
//
// Six rounds of "the page is broken" were spent on that gap. So the page writes
// the report itself, as a JSON file committed to a private repo through the
// viewer's own stored token, which is the same token the toss already uses to
// fetch the page. There is no server here: the repo is the server, which is the
// arrangement shortcut-tools has used for device probes since Log-Repo.
//
// IT REPORTS BY DEFAULT, and the first version of this file did not. It made
// the reader tap a button to arm it, which is the wrong shape twice over: it
// puts a step between a failure and its report exactly when nobody is thinking
// about reporting, and it asks the person with the least information in the
// system to decide whether this load is worth recording. Reported 2026-09-08 as
// "that just seems kind of nonsensical", which it was. A page opts in ONCE, in
// its own source, by calling `watch()`. After that it reports on its own.
//
// WHAT KEEPS THE VOLUME HONEST is not friction, it is having nothing to say:
//
// 1. **A clean load writes nothing.** `auto()` sends only when the page hands
//    over a fault, a crash breadcrumb or a named reason. Reporting being on is
//    not an instruction to record every load.
// 2. **The same failure is not filed twice.** A report carries a signature of
//    what it is reporting; an identical one inside the quiet window is dropped.
//    Without this, one persistent fault becomes one commit per reload, which is
//    how a log stops being read.
// 3. **A page load files at most a few.** A fault arriving in a loop must not
//    turn into a loop of commits.
// 4. **It never throws.** No token, no GH, no network: a result object saying
//    why, and nothing else. An instrument that can break the page it watches is
//    a second defect, which this estate has already shipped once.
//
// The off switch survives all of that, because a page that reports must always
// be answerable to the person holding it: `disable()` stops it durably, and
// `?report=off` in the address stops it for one load. Neither is the normal
// path, and neither needs a tap in the ordinary case.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not decide what a fault is; the page does, and
// hands it in. It does not read the report back or render it: that is a
// checkout, or pages/data-view.html against the log directory.
