// The estate's search calls, in one place, with one cache.
//
// Two consumers ask the same questions: the sidebar finder (a dispatcher whose
// deeper lanes are tap-gated) and the Search view (the central file surface).
// Each search existed first inside the finder component; extracting them here
// is what lets the view exist without a second implementation, and what makes
// the caches shared, so a tree the finder fetched is a tree the view never
// re-fetches. Pure fetch-and-match: no Alpine, no DOM, no rendering opinions.
// Consumers own reactivity by copying results into their own state.
//
// The calls, and what each honestly covers:
//
//   tree(repo, ref)    one recursive git/trees call per (repo, ref), cached
//                      for the session (the stage's Browse/Search economy).
//                      A FAILED fetch is not cached as an empty tree; it backs
//                      off briefly and retries, so a blip does not kill the
//                      file lanes until reload.
//   names(...)         substring match over tree paths, any ref, any repos,
//                      optionally scoped to a folder (`under`). Recursive and
//                      flat: it answers "which paths match".
//   level(...)         one level of one repo's tree, folders and files, off the
//                      same cache. It answers "what is in here", which has
//                      folders in it and is the question a recursive match
//                      cannot fold back into.
//
// Every file a caller gets back carries its SIZE IN BYTES, from the same
// recursive read: the trees API reports a blob's size on the entry, so nothing
// is fetched for it. This is the one thing the retired per-repo explorer had
// that the cached walk did not, and it turned out to cost nothing to keep.
//   code(...)          the GitHub code-search API: DEFAULT BRANCHES only,
//                      indexing can lag a push, files over ~384 KB are not
//                      indexed, 10 authenticated calls per minute. text-match
//                      returns the fragments consumers show as snippets. The
//                      names lane covers branches from the other side; that
//                      split is why both exist. It is also the one lane that
//                      DIAGNOSES its own failure, because it is the one whose
//                      refusal reaches the page as "Failed to fetch" and says
//                      nothing; see the note above diagnose().
//   sessions(...)      a client-side grep of the captured session records
//                      (web-tools-private sessions/, via state/sessions.json):
//                      what a record quotes, meaning the opening ask, every
//                      stored prompt, every stored reply, and the closing
//                      message (search.py's --grep, in the browser). One
//                      contents read per record, cached for the session. Plus
//                      what the session is CALLED, which is not something a
//                      record quotes: the exported title where one is known and
//                      the derived branch name either way. See nameSegs below
//                      for why both ride the same corpus here and get their own
//                      flag at the terminal.

  // `fetch` rejecting is not GitHub answering: the browser refused to hand the
  // response over and the page never saw a status, so gh-api can only report
  // the browser's own words, which are "Failed to fetch". Measured 2026-08-31:
  // a response with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header produces exactly
  // that, while a sibling call to the same host in the same page returns 200.
  // So the reading a reader needs is the one the string cannot carry, whether
  // GitHub refused this endpoint or the connection went away.

  // limit, so asking costs nothing, and it reports `code_search` (10/min) and
  // `search` (30/min) as separate buckets. Three outcomes, and the second call
  // is what tells them apart:
  //
  //   it fails too         the host is unreachable, said as that
  //   code_search spent    the limit, named, with the seconds until it resets
  //   budget left          reachable and not the limit, so the refusal was
  //                        GitHub's and the browser was not shown the reason
