// A RENDERED VIEW OF A SOURCE FILE SAYS SO, AND SAYS WHICH FILE.
//
// That is the whole of this kit, and it is deliberately the whole: what the
// source IS (markdown with sections, code with lines, something later) belongs
// to the kit that renders it. This holds only the part every one of them needs,
// which is the announcement.
//
// It was kits/md-doc.js's, privately, until 2026-08-31. Nothing was wrong with
// it there while markdown was the only kind that declared; the moment a second
// one did, the choice was to copy twenty-five lines or to lift them, and the
// estate has spent this branch removing the results of the first choice.
//
// THE STATE IS A PROPERTY, THE ATTRIBUTE IS THE FINDABLE HALF. A declaration
// carries the source text, and an attribute would mean serializing a document
// into the DOM. `stateOf` walks up to the nearest declared box and reads the
// property off it.
//
// DECLARING ANNOUNCES, because the surfaces that care are built before the
// render happens: kits/annotate.js's card is mounted when the annotator is
// enabled, and an aim has no business existing on a page with nothing to aim
// at. A chip decided once at mount would be wrong on every deck, where the
// slide renders later and again on every swipe. One event is cheaper than a
// poll and honest in both directions.

  // Every declaration carries `kind`, the row from docs/routes-kinds.csv that
  // says what this render is. The rest is the declaring kit's own: md-doc adds
  // `sections`, code-doc adds `lines`.

  // WHAT A DOCUMENT DECLARES, for a caller with no node in hand. `stateOf`
  // reads from a node up; this reads from the document down, which is the
  // question a CONTROL asks before anything has been aimed at.
  //
  // TWO CONDITIONS, and both are needed. The kind has to DECLARE an aim, and
  // the render has to have something for it to hit.
  //
  // The first is the row: source code declares and offers no aim of its own,
  // since a line range is what an ordinary text selection already spans, while
  // markdown offers one because a section is a run of siblings no selection
  // lands on cleanly. The second is `units`, which the declaring kit counts in
  // its own terms (md-doc: sections; code-doc: lines). A heading-less markdown
  // file declares with zero and an aim that cannot hit anything is worse than
  // an absent one, which md-doc found the hard way before the count moved here.
  //
  // Counting them separately per kind was the alternative, and it puts the same
  // rule in every kit that ever declares.
  //
  // TWO READINGS OF ONE RULE, and the split is what a caller is asking about.
  // `declaredAll` is every qualifying render in document order; `declaredIn` is
  // the first of them. The singular one answers "does this document declare
  // anything", which is what a CONTROL asks before it decides whether to offer
  // an aim at all, and one render's kind is every render's kind for that
  // purpose.
  //
  // It is the wrong answer to "where is the markdown on this page", and that is
  // what the plural one exists for. A page can hold several renders: the file
  // deck mounts four at once, and a doc beside a preview is two. kits/annotate.js
  // drew its section rules from the singular reading until 2026-09-06, so a
  // second render was fully pickable (locate() walks up from the tapped node, so
  // it finds whichever box contains it) and completely unmarked. The reader was
  // shown where one of the two documents was and left to find the other by
  // guessing.
