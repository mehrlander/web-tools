// kits/md-doc.js — a markdown document rendered as something you can read and
// take pieces OUT of.
//
// Three jobs over one render, and the first two are the same job seen from
// either end:
//
//   CONTAIN    a wide table, code block or image scrolls or shrinks inside its
//              own box rather than widening the column it sits in. Without this
//              the widest thing in a doc sets the width of everything around it,
//              and a reader dragging sideways to see column six drags the prose
//              with it.
//   CUT        every heading gets a control over THAT SECTION'S SOURCE: copy
//              it, copy it with a revision ask on top, or open a note pinned
//              to it. Wikipedia's [edit] link, answering a different verb: the
//              unit a reader wants to act on is the section, and what they
//              want to act on it WITH is the markdown, not the HTML it was
//              rendered into.
//   DECLARE    the rendered box says which source and which address it is a
//              rendering OF, so any node inside it can be answered for in the
//              source's terms. That is what lets a note read
//              `docs/APP.md § Mechanism (lines 16-28)` rather than
//              `article > p:nth-of-type(3) [42-57]`.
//
// The two arrived together because they are the same complaint from two sides.
// A rendered document is a reading surface that has thrown away its source:
// the table has lost the pipes that would have let it wrap, and the section has
// lost the `##` that would have let it travel. Both are recoverable only by the
// surface that still holds the source, which is this one.
//
// WHY THE SOURCE AND NOT THE SELECTION. Copying a rendered section gives you
// prose with the structure flattened out: a table becomes tab-separated runs, a
// link becomes its label, a fenced block loses its fence. Handing that to a
// model and asking for a revision gets you a revision of the flattening. The
// source slice is the thing that can be revised and put back, which is the
// whole point of cutting at a section rather than at a paragraph.
//
//   mdDoc.split(src)                 -> [{ index, depth, title, slug, raw,
//                                          start, end, startLine, endLine }]
//   mdDoc.reference(sec, addr)       -> the provenance line(s), as an array
//   mdDoc.payload(sec, addr)         -> reference + blank line + sec.raw
//   mdDoc.html(src, o?)              -> a prose HTML STRING, tables contained
//   mdDoc.render(host, src, o?)      -> mounts into host; returns { box, sections }
//   mdDoc.enhance(box, src, o?)      -> the same over markup another renderer made
//   mdDoc.contain(el)                -> el, nothing left that can widen a column
//   mdDoc.locate(node)               -> { addr, sections, section } for any node in a render
//   mdDoc.sourceRef(node)            -> "docs/APP.md § Mechanism (lines 16-28)"
//
// `addr` is `{ repo, ref, path, url }`, all optional. It is what makes a copied
// section worth pasting: a section with no address is a passage nobody can find
// again, and the address is the half the reader cannot reconstruct.
//
// THE THREE VERBS ARE ONE MENU, not three buttons. A heading has room for one
// mark, and the reader's question at a heading is "what can I do with this
// part", which a menu answers and three glyphs make them decode. The note row
// appears only where `window.Annotate` is actually running, since a control
// that opens nothing is worse than an absent one.
//
// SECTIONS NEST, the way Wikipedia's do: a section runs from its heading to the
// next heading of EQUAL OR HIGHER rank, so copying `## Surfacing primitives`
// brings its `###` subsections with it and each of those still has its own
// control. A reader asking for "this section" nearly always means the part of
// the document under that title, not the paragraphs before the next subheading.
//
// Requires `window.marked` to be loaded already (the same lazy load every other
// markdown surface here does), and reads `window.io.copy` when it is present
// for the iOS clipboard path. No Alpine, no gh, no DOM opinions of its own: it
// takes the host it is handed.
//
// kits/chat-render.js carries its own copy of the table wrap, and keeps it: it
// is a standalone script a page can drop in from jsDelivr with nothing else,
// and tools/test/chat-render-wide-table.test.mjs pins it there. The wrap is six
// lines; the independence is worth more than the six.

  // ── Contain ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Three elements can be wider than the column they are in, and each widens it
  // rather than being clipped by it. A TABLE's intrinsic min-content width (the
  // longest unbreakable run in each column) is a floor no ancestor can shrink
  // below. A PRE is `white-space: pre`, so a long command line does not wrap at
  // all. An IMG is its own pixel width. In a swipe-deck slide, the thing that
  // ends up scrolling is the SLIDE, which drags the headings and the prose
  // sideways along with whatever overflowed and reads as the document being
  // broken.
  //
  // The table's wrapper does not force `max-content` on it. Typography's default
  // `width: 100%` still wraps cells, so a table that CAN fit still fits and only
  // one that genuinely cannot starts scrolling. Same call, and the same reasons,
  // as chat-render's.
  //
  // INLINE STYLES, NOT UTILITY CLASSES, and that is the lesson kits/guide-render.js
  // paid for: a class that arrives in the DOM from a JS string depends on the
  // Tailwind browser build having generated a rule for it, and when it has not
  // there is no error anywhere, just a layout that quietly does not hold. The
  // `pre` case makes the point twice over, since the rule that normally saves it
  // belongs to the typography plugin: a page that renders prose without loading
  // that plugin has `overflow-x: visible` on every code block. Measured 2026-08-26
  // in the headless render, where the plugin ships no dist CSS and resolves to a
  // miss: a 922px command line inside a 398px column, slide scrollWidth 938
  // against a 430px track. The utility classes stay on the wrapper as the

  // address", and any node inside it can then be answered for in the source's
  // own terms rather than the DOM's. kits/annotate.js is the first consumer:
  // its `Path:` line reads `docs/APP.md § Mechanism (lines 16-28)` instead of
  // `article > p:nth-of-type(3) [42-57]`, which is the difference between a
  // note a model can act on and a note it has to go looking for.
  //
  // THE CARRIER IS kits/src-doc.js, which owns the attribute, the property and
  // the announcement for every kind that declares. This kit supplies the
  // markdown half: the sections, and the reference line that names one.

  // THE ROW THIS RENDER ANSWERS TO in docs/routes-kinds.csv, carried on the
  // declaration so a reader of the DOM gets the vocabulary without fetching a
  // registry. kits/annotate.js is that reader: its Section row is labelled from
  // `aimLabel` and `aimHint` rather than from strings of its own, so the aim
  // says what it is about instead of saying "Section" on a page that has four
  // other structures in it.
  //
  // `aimIcon` IS PART OF THAT VOCABULARY, and it was not until 2026-09-06. The
  // label travelled and the glyph did not: both surfaces that draw this aim
  // hardcoded `ph-text-align-left`, so the next kind to declare would have
  // inherited markdown's icon along with its own name, and the row a reader saw
  // said "alignment" about a document. A kind that names its aim now names its
  // mark too.
  //
  // ph-file-md, NOT ph-markdown-logo, and the difference is what the aim is
  // ABOUT. The logo is the format, and kits/annotate.js already spends it on
  // the serialization key that shows the set as markdown; two of them in one
  // card header, one lit and one not, would be the same glyph for two unrelated
  // questions. This aim points at a markdown DOCUMENT sitting on the page, so
  // it takes the document mark, which also pairs with the Page aim's ph-file
  // two buttons to its left: this page, or this markdown document.
  //
  // The registry is the owner and tools/test/routes-manifest.test.mjs holds the
