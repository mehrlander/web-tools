// kits/file-deck.js — a changeset's files, read one at a time.
//
// The Files pane is a LIST, and a list is for scanning: thirty hairline rows,
// each one a `fileReview` card that expands in place. Reading a diff through it
// means expanding a row, scrolling past it, collapsing, expanding the next. That
// is a good way to find a file and a poor way to read one.
//
// This is the other half: the same cards, one per slide, in the house swipe deck
// (kits/swipe-deck.js). It opens as a DRILL, one level below whatever deck or
// takeover the reader was already in, so the header becomes the file's and
// leaving it returns them to the branch. One deck visible, one meaning for the
// swipe, and the nesting only in the return path. The reasoning for that shape
// over a nested pager or a level picker is in swipe-deck's drilling note.
//
//   fileDeck.open({ repo, ref, base, baseName, files, start, title, subtitle,
//                   parent, onClose }) -> the deck handle
//
//   files      [{ path, previousPath, status, additions, deletions, patch }],
//              the shape kits/branch-brief.js already assembles and the shape
//              the compare API hands back. Pass the list the reader can SEE:
//              a collapsed registry group is a group they chose not to open, so
//              its files do not belong in the deck either. That makes the pane's
//              group toggles the deck's filter, with no second control.
//   start      index to open on, so "read from here" lands on the right file
//   parent     the deck handle to drill from, when there is one. drill() takes
//              the crumb from its title and turns the dismiss button into a
//              back chevron.
//   The deck also LISTS itself, through swipe-deck's `index` labeler: the header
//   mark opens every file in the changeset, current one marked. A changeset is
//   exactly the case that wants it, since the footer draws dots only while they
//   stay countable and a thirty-file branch is well past that. What a row says
//   is the file and what happened to it, which is the pane's own reading of the
//   compare rather than a second one.
//
//   announce   default true: say what the reader is on through the subject
//              channel the FAB listens to (see the note above open()). Pass
//              false for a deck that should not retarget the sidebar.
//   back       force the chevron without a parent DECK. The branch takeover is
//              the case: it is chrome of its own rather than a swipe-deck, so
//              there is no handle to drill from, but dismissing still returns
//              the reader one level up and the glyph has to say so. An ✕ there
//              would promise to close something it does not close.
//
// Three slides mount at a time (swipe-deck renders the active one and its
// neighbours), which is why every card here can start OPEN. The Files pane
// cannot: it has to hedge with `open: files.length <= 12 && innerWidth >= 768`,
// because twelve open cards is twelve fetches at once and most of a phone
// screen. A deck is one file at a time by construction, so the hedge does not
// apply and the reader gets the content without a tap.
//
// Open on WHAT is the other half, and it is why the cards here are passed
// `read` and `bare`. This is a reading surface, so a file opens as itself: a
// doc rendered, an image shown, a `.gz` inflated, a source file diffed. And the
// deck header already names the file, so the card drops its own collapsed row
// rather than printing the path a second time, elided a second way.
//
// Requires kits/swipe-deck.js, kits/subject-channel.js and the fileReview
// Alpine component. All three ride in the pre-build, so a page that has the
// bundle has them; a page on a gh.load chain names them itself.

  // keep the general one, which is the wrong half to lose twice over.
  //
  // Budget the crumb instead and spend it from the LEFT. The last part is the
