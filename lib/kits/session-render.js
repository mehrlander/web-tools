// session-render.js — a session record as a readable conversation.
//
// The store in web-tools-private keeps one JSON record per Claude Code session
// (its sessions/README.md is the schema). Through schema 3 that record was a
// log: what was asked, what tools ran, and counts. Schema 4 added `replies`,
// the assistant's own prose, which is what makes the file a conversation and
// this file worth having.
//
// Framework-free and DOM-rendering, the same shape as chat-render.js and
// vanilla-demo.js, loaded via gh.load. It composes rather than duplicates:
// chat-render.js renders a turn and promotes fenced blocks to live artifacts,
// swipe-deck.js owns the track and the takeover, claude-mark.js owns the
// logomark on the header's session link. Load all three first; in this repo
// gh-boot already carries claude-mark, so a page's chain names only the two.
//
//   await sessionRender.ready()                  // chatRender.ready(), once
//   sessionRender.turns(record)   -> [{role, md, ts, label}]  one merged sequence
//   sessionRender.groups(turns)   -> [[turn]]    the deck's slide grouping
//   sessionRender.blocks(card)    -> [{turn}|{tools,…}|{steps,label}]  card layout
//   sessionRender.outline(record) -> [{i,title,source,kind,role,ts,ran,calls,turns,
//                                     exchange}]
//   sessionRender.describe(record)-> {title, subtitle}
//   await sessionRender.open(record, o?)  -> {el, close}   fullscreen takeover
//                                  o.parent drills from an open deck instead
//   await sessionRender.deck(record, o?)  -> element       inline deck
//
// kits/session-export.js is the optional fifth: load it after this one and the
// takeover grows an Export button, which opens the turn picker on the card the
// reader is looking at. Pass `export: false` to suppress it.
//
// ── Why the merge works, and why it is here rather than in the record ───────
//
// `prompts`, `replies` and `calls` are three parallel lists in the record, each
// carrying `at`. The record deliberately does not interleave them: each has its
// own caps and its own accounting, and a reader wanting only the asks should
// not have to filter a mixed list. So deciding what a "turn" is belongs to
// whatever renders one, which is this file.
//
// ── A card is one exchange, and the tool calls fold ────────────────────────
//
// A new card starts at each user ask, so a slide carries the whole of one
// exchange: the question, every sentence of the answer, and everything that
// ran in between. That is the unit a reader is looking for. Swiping lands on
// "the time I asked about X" rather than partway through answering it, and the
// contents list becomes a list of questions.
//
// It only works because the machinery folds. A run of tool calls plus the
// short assistant turn that announced it ("Now let me render it to check the
// pixels") is one STEP, and a run of adjacent steps collapses into ONE fold
// covering the whole of the preparation. So a card is the question, one line
// for everything done to answer it, and the reply. Opening that line lays the
// work out flat, sentence then calls, step after step. Measured over the 154
// schema-4 records in the store on 2026-08-26: 2,458 exchanges, median 10
// calls and 3 prose turns each, and 94% of the narrating turns fold. The tail
// is real and stays honest rather than being split: p90 is 44 calls, and the
// largest single exchange is 339, which is one line until someone opens it.
//
// This replaces the first grouping, which started a card at each ask AND at
// each assistant prose turn, with the calls attaching to the prose above them.
// That was the right call before the fold existed, since the alternative then
// was a slide carrying a hundred expanded tool entries. What it cost was the
// exchange: the same store came to 14,297 cards, so a question and its answer
// were five or six swipes apart and the pager clustered them with a margin.
// The fold buys the condensation the split was paying for, so the split is
// gone and the exchange is back.
//
// The prose turn still carries the reading: it is what a fold hangs under, and
// what titles a card when the ask says little. That remains the reason schema 4
// had to land before any of this.

  // ── One tool call as a turn ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // The arg is what ran; the body is what came back. When no body was kept, the
  // entry still says how much there was, because `bytes` and `sha` ride every
  // call whether or not its body survived, and "4.2 KB not kept" is a different
  // statement from an empty result.
  // `parts` splits the same string two ways rather than building it twice: the
  // deck reads `md` and never looks at the halves, while session-export.js
  // emits the argument without the result body (the usual way an excerpt stays
  // small enough to paste). Keeping the split here rather than in the exporter
  // means the fencing heuristics above have one owner; a second reader deriving
  // its own would be a second answer to "is this JSON".
  // ── A dispatch shows the work, not the receipt (schema 8) ────────────────
  // An `Agent` call's own result is a launch receipt: an id, and a sentence
  // telling the main loop not to quote it. Rendering 124 of those renders
  // nothing, which is what this deck did for a fan-out before schema 8.
  //
  // The record now carries what each agent then DID, joined to its dispatch by
  // `tool_use_id`, so the dispatch turn shows that instead. Both fan-out
  // shapes are covered because they carry their work in different places: a
  // judgment agent's is its `returned` prose, a structured agent's is the
  // content of the files it wrote, and a run of 124 is legible only if the
  // label names which agent each one was.

  // list and the files it wrote stay in the record rather than in the card,

  // panel's three agents still arrive whole, because there the authored file IS

  // the store on 2026-08-09, that lands somewhere between half and 76% usable
  // (a pattern classifier says 76%, reading a sample by hand says about half;
  // the classifier can only catch failure shapes someone thought to write down).
  //
  // The residue splits four ways and only ONE of them is a model's problem:
  //
  //   markdown noise (5.2%)  a lead beginning with a branch anchor, a code
  //                          span, a heading, an upload path. An extraction
  //                          bug. Skipped, and the next sentence tried.
  //   too short (11.2%)      "Done." carries nothing. Also extraction: fall
  //                          through to the next sentence, and failing that,
  //                          say what the card DID from its tool calls.
  //   procedural ask (4.7%)  "Please proceed with the identified work." There
  //                          is nothing to summarize; a model would invent
  //                          something. Left as it is, honestly.
  //   result-only (3.3%)     "All five merged." The substance is in the body.
  //                          This one a model would genuinely improve.
  //
  // So this is the foundation and a label from a model is a later polish pass
  // on a minority. It is computed rather than committed for the same reason:
  // a deterministic derivation of data already in the record earns no second
  // copy. That changes the day something writes labels a rerun cannot

  // this kit already knows how to draw. Reported 2026-09-01: "I'm not sure why
  // we need these two different representations ultimately." There is no
  // reason, and this is the export that removes it.
  //
  // `collapse` is the one thing a caller reasonably differs on. A deck slide is
  // the whole screen and clamps nothing (cardOpts); a list of cards wants a
  // ceiling per turn, and chat-render's own clamp gives the fade and the "Show

  // It carries the Claude logomark rather than the deck's default arrow, which
  // is the estate's standard way to say "this goes to a session" and the same
  // mark the Sessions rows, the branch rows and pages/session.html draw beside
  // one. The deck is generic and the mark is not, so the mark is supplied here:
  // a deck over a staged fileset gets the arrow, and this one names its exit.
  //
  // The Export action appears only when kits/session-export.js is loaded, which
  // is the dependency running the other way: that kit reads this one, so this
  // one may not require it. The check is at open() time rather than at load,
  // so the chain order is the caller's business and a page that never loads the
  // exporter simply gets a deck with no export button.
  // A mark per kind, so the list reads as a shape before it reads as text. The
  // titles are mechanical and land somewhere between half and 76% usable (see
  // the note over outline()), and the icon is the half that never misses: what
  // a card IS comes from whether its lead was an ask and whether it issued

  // is where you asked something," and that is most of what a reader scanning
