// kits/branch-brief.js — a branch as a subject, not a row.
//
// Every branch surface in this repo is a LIST: the estate's Open view, the
// per-repo Branches view, the FAB's render tab. Each one ends in a link out to
// github.com, because there was nowhere of ours to go. This kit is the model
// behind a page for ONE branch, so those rows finally have a destination.
//
// Two layers, and the split is the whole design:
//
//   DERIVED   assembled from the API on every load. Identity, state, lifespan,
//             ahead/behind, the authoring sessions, the PR, the changed files.
//             Nothing here is authored, so nothing here can go stale: the page
//             is current by construction and needs no sync step. That is what
//             a hand-maintained markdown PR body cannot offer, and why the
//             question "is this up to date?" simply does not arise here.
//
//   AUTHORED  an optional envelope carrying judgment the API cannot know: why
//             the branch exists, what to scrutinize, what is still open, what
//             was deliberately left out. Same delivery split as the rest of the
//             envelope family (docs/envelopes/): `?src=` a spec, or `#gz=` a
//             gzipped payload, discriminated bare-vs-envelope the way
//             data-payload.js does it rather than by asking the caller.
//
// The layers are independent on purpose. A branch with no envelope still
// renders completely; the envelope only ever adds. That is what lets the page
// ship before any authoring convention exists for it.
//
// Reading splits two ways, and both axes are about the surface rather than
// about the data.
//
//   fetch* vs read*   `fetchBrief` always asks GitHub; `readBrief` puts a
//                     sixty-second read-through cache in front of it, for a
//                     surface that opens the same branch repeatedly inside one
//                     pass. The swiper steps back and forth over a list and
//                     warms its neighbours, and re-reading a branch the reader
//                     crossed ten seconds ago is the cost that makes stepping
//                     feel like waiting. See the note above the cache for why a
//                     TTL is the only form of it that keeps this page's
//                     freshness claim honest.
//
//   guide vs compare  the PR list is a few KB and the compare is most of a
//                     megabyte on a repo that commits a bundle. `readGuide` and
//                     `readCompare` are separate so a surface can render the
//                     judgment layer and fetch the diff only if the reader asks
//                     for it; `readBrief` is both, for a caller that wants the
//                     whole branch in one await. `assemble` tolerates the
//                     compare being absent and says so with `pending`.
//
// Pure below the one orchestrator: no DOM, no Alpine. `gh` is any object
// carrying the GH proto (compare, req), so the whole thing tests against a fake
// gh with no network. Attaches to window.BranchBrief.

  // Every PR the branch has had, not the newest one: a merge ends a PR but not
  // the branch, so post-merge work opens a second, and a page that reads only
  // `pulls[0]` shows one of them with no way to reach the other. The FAB's
  // guide pane learned this first and stepped through them; this returns the
  // list so a reader here can too.
  //
  // The COMPARE call carries ahead/behind, the commits and the changed files in
  // one response, and the files come with every patch embedded. There is no way
  // to ask for a subset: on a repo whose commits regenerate a bundle it is most
  // of a megabyte, 88% of it one generated file nobody opens. Measured on
  // web-tools 2026-08-14: 1.82 MB of patch over 23 files, 1.60 MB of it
  // `dist/web-tools.js`, whose own diff is 52 lines, three of them a quarter of

  // stepped past ten seconds ago.
  //
  // The reconciliation is a TTL, not a session-lifetime store. Inside one
  // reading pass a step is free and a step back is free; leave the takeover
  // open while work lands and the next visit reads GitHub again. Sixty seconds
