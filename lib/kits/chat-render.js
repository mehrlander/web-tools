// chat-render.js — chat transcript renderer: markdown in, readable
// conversation out, with fenced code blocks promoted to live artifacts.
//
// Assistant output is markdown, because it is. A user turn is not: it is
// whatever someone typed or pasted into a chat box, so it renders as plain
// text, truncated with an expander (see "raw turns" below). Pass
// `raw: true|false` to override the split for a turn.
//
// Sibling to vanilla-demo.js: a framework-free, DOM-rendering module loaded
// via gh.load. Depends on swipe-deck.js for the deck and the fullscreen
// takeover (the house swipe format, shared with any other page that pages
// through cards) and on kits/proof.js for sandboxed Render/Run frames
// (load both first), on Tailwind + daisyUI + Phosphor on the host page for
// styling, and on the typography CSS for prose (see pages/chat-results.html
// for the combine link). marked loads lazily via ready(); CM6 and Tabulator
// load only when a block's Edit or Table affordance is used.
//
//   await chatRender.ready();                    // loads marked, once
//   chatRender.parse(md)          -> [{role, md}]    // house-format splitter
//   chatRender.exchanges(msgs)    -> [[msg]]     // the deck's slide grouping
//   chatRender.markdown(md, o?)   -> element     // prose + block artifacts
//   chatRender.block({lang,code}, o?) -> element // one fenced-block artifact
//                                                // (o.fill: fill the parent, code scrolling
//                                                // inside it, instead of the line clamp)

//
// The block artifact is the point: every fenced block renders instantly as a
// static <pre> (no editor cost), with a view row that builds on demand —
// viewer.js's registry idea keyed on fence language instead of file
// extension, backed by proof.js's sandboxes instead of Prism:
//
//   lang        views
//   html/svg    Code | Render   (sandboxed iframe; full documents srcdoc'd)
//   json array  Code | Table    (Tabulator, lazy)
//   md          Code | Preview  (marked)
//   other       Code
//
// The chats arrive as regular provider output — they don't know this
// renderer exists — so a view is offered only where an arbitrary block
// stands on its own. Markup fragments do; a js block is usually a piece
// of some larger thing, so js gets no Run view (executing it out of
// context just produces reference errors). Nothing executes on load:
// Render and Table build on first click. Chat code is arbitrary, so
// there is no unsandboxed 'parent' kind here. The Edit pencil always
// lands on the Code view and swaps the static <pre> for a CM6 editor
// (kits/cm6.js, lazy-loaded) — editing is editing the source text, never
// the rendered view (Tabulator stays read-only). Views built from older
// text rebuild from the edited text when re-activated.

  //
  // Headless could not see it. tools/render/cdn.mjs serves this stylesheet as a

  // USER_FILL_X is where the fill starts and USER_FILL_PAD how tightly it hugs;
  // the text column is their sum. X IS LEAD_INDENT's number, so the fill's left
  // edge lands on the one vertical the card already has: the column every other
  // role's text starts at. That is what leaves clear air after the glyph, which
  // occupies 0 to 11px and paints its ink inside about 9 of those.
  //
  // It was 10 for one release, chosen to tuck under the glyph's trailing edge on
  // the argument that any wider read as a second indent. At 10 the fill starts
  // one pixel inside the icon's own box, so there is no gap at all: the tint
  // arrives touching the glyph and the pair reads as one object, which is the
  // complaint the gutter was introduced to answer. A gap that lands on an
  // existing column is not a second indent.
  //
  // THE ICON LEAVES THE TEXT FLOW for this one role. The hanging indent below
  // exists so a wrapped line clears the glyph; with the lead positioned in the
  // gutter there is nothing to clear, and keeping the hang would pull the FIRST
  // line out of the left edge of its own fill, which is what it did when this

  // where the content said "sentence". Pinning the width to the widest rendered
  // line box ends it where the text ends and keeps it ONE RECTANGLE, which

  //
  // IT CANNOT RE-WRAP WHAT IT MEASURED. Every line already fits inside the
  // widest one, and the new content box is exactly that width, so each line
  // still fits by construction and the break points hold. What it cannot know
  // is a row whose width is a SUM rather than a line: the long-paste footer
  // puts a size, a spacer and two buttons on one row, and no single text run in
  // it measures the whole. So the pin is checked for overflow and dropped

  //   (the icon, the rail, the indent, and mono against prose). Every other
  //   role keeps its word, and so does a caller-set label: the reply card's
  //   "closing reply" is a fidelity claim about that turn and not decoration;
  //
  //   the assistant turn INDENTS under the ask and drops to DENSE_PX with a
