// note.js — the NOTE of the house popup rule: `data-note="…"` in place of
// `title="…"`. The rule itself, and where a note ends and a card begins, is
// stated once, in daisy-alpine/references/mechanics.md ("Notes and cards").
// This file implements the note and does not restate the rule.
//
// Framework-free, DOM-only, one delegated listener set, the same shape as
// dock-split.js and swipe-deck.js. Load it and every `[data-note]` on the page
// works, including elements written later by innerHTML, because nothing is
// attached per element.
//
//   <span data-note="Fetched from the repo when opened.">EXTERNAL</span>
//
// Three optional attributes ride beside it, none of them required:
//
//   data-note-title  a lead line above the note: what the note is ABOUT, where
//                    `data-note` is what it says. A comment's author, a form
//                    field's name, a term before its definition. Rendered bold
//                    on its own row, as textContent, never as markup.
//   data-note-bare   suppress the dotted underline, for an element that has no
//                    room for one (a table cell, an svg <text>).
//   data-note-look   which look the panel takes. The kit ships two: the styled
//                    default, and `plain`, the browser's own tooltip redrawn
//                    (square, no shadow, one size smaller) for a note of a few
//                    words, a header unwrapped, a unit spelled out, where the
//                    styled box reads as more than the text deserves. Resolved
//                    with `closest()`, so `<body data-note-look="plain">` or a
//                    section sets a default and a note can still override it.
//                    Any other token is stamped on the panel as `data-look` and
//                    styled by the page: the sheet render asks for "excel" and
//                    draws Excel's comment box, on a page already drawing Excel.
//
//   Note.open(elOrSelector)   // for a screenshot, or to point at something
//   Note.close()
//   Note.text(el)             // the note string, or null. The lead line is
//                             // read separately, off data-note-title.
//   Note.fits(el)             // false where the note would have to scroll.
//
// ── Two properties that make it a note rather than a restyled `title` ───────
//
// The text is in the DOM, so a screenshot captures it, a phone reaches it, and
// it renders in the page's theme. And the panel holds NOTHING TAPPABLE: no
// link, no button, and no scrollbar. That second property is the whole line
// between a note and a card, and two consequences follow from it here.
//
//   A note FITS. The panel has a maximum height (LINES below) and never
//   scrolls, because a scrolling box has to take the pointer, and a box that
//   takes the pointer is a card. A note that would overflow is a defect in the
//   page, not a layout to accommodate: open() clips it and says so once in the
//   console, naming the element, and Note.fits(el) answers the same question
//   for a test. Move the content to a card.
//
//   A note CLOSES ON ITS OWN TAP. On a screen that cannot hover, the panel
//   takes the tap (pointer-events:auto under `hover: none`) and closes,
//   swallowing it, so the reader never has to find neutral ground on a dense
//   page to dismiss a note. Tap-outside still closes it, and still lets the tap
//   through to what was tapped, which is the courtesy and not the route. Where
//   the pointer can hover the panel stays uninterceptable, so it never sits
//   between the pointer and the control it describes.
//
// ── The accessibility argument, which cuts against the obvious design ───────
//
// `title` is announced by screen readers. A tooltip that is only visual would
// therefore be a REGRESSION dressed as an improvement, so this follows the
// WAI-ARIA tooltip pattern rather than inventing one: the trigger is focusable,
// the panel is `role="tooltip"`, it opens on focus as well as hover, and
// `aria-describedby` points at it while it is open. The cost is a tab stop per
// note, which is the correct trade and is also the only way a keyboard reaches
// the note at all. A trigger that is already focusable (a button, a link) keeps
// its own tabindex.
