// record-deck.js: a table's records, read one at a time.
//
// A grid is for SCANNING. Thirty columns wide and four hundred rows deep, it
// answers "which row" superbly and "what does this row say" not at all: on a
// phone the answer is off the right edge, and on a desktop it is a horizontal
// scroll with the identifying column long gone. This is the other half, and it
// is the same split kits/file-deck.js makes between the Files pane and the file
// deck. One record per slide, every field on screen, in the house swipe deck
// (kits/swipe-deck.js).
//
//   recordDeck.open({ rows, columns, start, title, … })  -> the deck handle
//   recordDeck.fromGrid(tabulatorTable, { … })           -> the deck handle
//
// GENERIC BY CONSTRUCTION, because the collections it has to serve have nothing
// in common but their shape. The budget-drs data explorer alone holds 100
// tables whose widths run 1, median 6, to 90 columns, so a format tuned for a
// six-column table is wrong for a third of them and a format tuned for ninety
// is absurd for the rest. What survives that range is a field list that gets
// out of the way: no fixed column count, no truncation, and the one dimension
// that actually varies (how many fields are empty) handled explicitly rather
// than by hoping.
//
// open() options:
//   rows       [{}], the records. Plain objects; nothing else is assumed.
//   columns    [{ field, title?, num? }], optional. Derived from the rows when
//              absent (see deriveColumns), which is what makes a bare CSV or a
//              JSON array work with no configuration at all.
//   start      index to open on, so "read from here" lands on the right record
//   titleField which field is the card's headline. Defaults to the first
//              non-numeric column, since that is nearly always the name of the
//              thing: `vendor`, `agency`, `path`, `title`.
//   describe   (field) => string | null, an optional per-column note rendered
//              under its label. The hook exists because SOME hosts know what
//              their columns mean (budget-drs carries a column dictionary at
//              data/design/lineage/columns.csv) and most do not, and a kit that
//              REQUIRED the knowledge would be unusable everywhere else.
//   title, subtitle, icon, parent, onClose, announceEmpty
//              as swipe-deck's, with `parent` drilling one level down.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately: any way of getting in. The affordance is
// swipeDeck.entry() and it belongs to the host, because only the host knows
// where its own chrome has room and whether the reader has anything to read
// yet. A surface may also add a gesture of its own (a row tap), and that stays
// the surface's call rather than a convention this kit imposes.
//
// Requires kits/swipe-deck.js. No Alpine, no gh, no Tabulator: fromGrid reads a
// Tabulator table when handed one, and the kit works identically with none.
