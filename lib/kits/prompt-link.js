// kits/prompt-link.js — mint a link that starts a new session somewhere else.
//
// The estate is full of surfaces that KNOW something and then stop: a session
// row naming the repos a session worked in, a FAB rendering a page at a ref, a
// dictation page holding words you just spoke. In every one of them the next
// move is the same, "go do something about this," and until now the only route
// was to open claude.ai/code in another tab and re-say by hand what the page
// already had on screen. This kit is the last hop, and nothing else: it turns
// facts a caller already holds into an address.
//
// It mints links. It does not open them, does not read the DOM, and has no
// opinion about what the prompt says. Callers supply `owner/repo` slugs; the
// checkout-name to slug join belongs to whoever holds the repo list (the estate
// does it in sessionFileUrl and guideRenderFor already), not here.
//
//   PromptLink.code(o)    -> { url, carried, dropped }   Claude Code, new session
//   PromptLink.chat(o)    -> { url, carried, dropped }   ChatGPT, new chat
//   PromptLink.url(t, o)  -> the same, by target key
//   PromptLink.targets    -> the row per destination, including the ones that
//                            cannot be reached and why
//   PromptLink.fits(text) -> does this prompt ride inline
//
// NAMED FOR WHAT A ROW OF ITS OUTPUT IS, which is a link carrying a prompt.
// It was `dispatch` for one commit and that word is spoken for twice over in
// this estate: the SESSION DISPATCHER is the SessionStart hook that runs every
// checkout's session-*.sh (docs/PORTABLE.md), and DISPATCH is the phone-to-desktop
// relay in docs/venues.md. Neither has anything to do with this. `StageLink` is
// the naming precedent: a minter is named for the address it mints.
//
// ── The parameters, and where they come from ───────────────────────────────
//
// Claude Code's are documented, which is the reason this kit leads with it and
// the reason it is the only target that can take a repository at all:
// code.claude.com/docs/en/web-quickstart#pre-fill-sessions names `prompt` (alias
// `q`), `prompt_url`, `repositories` (alias `repo`) and `environment`. The
// canonical spellings are used here; the aliases are read by the same endpoint
// and buy nothing.
//
// THE LINK PREFILLS AND NEVER SUBMITS. That is the documented behaviour and it
// is also the only reason this is safe to put behind a one-tap control: the
// worst a mis-tap can do is open a form. Nothing here should ever be changed to
// a target that fires on arrival without the caller saying so out loud, which
// is why the ChatGPT row below carries `submits: true` as a field rather than a
// footnote.
//
// ── The one thing that cannot travel: a branch per repo ─────────────────────
//
// `repositories` is a comma-separated list of slugs and carries no branch. The
// app-route deep link (claude://code/new) takes `repo` singular plus `branch`,
// so the two routes trade off: many repos without branches, or one repo with
// one. A session scope is routinely mixed (a live record from this repo's own
// store: shortcut-tools and web-tools-private on a feature branch, web-tools on
// main), so the multi-repo case is the common one and the branch is the thing
// that gets left behind.
//
// It is left behind LOUDLY. `dropped` names every input that could not ride,
// and the caller is expected to say so rather than let a reader assume the
// branch went with it. A silently narrowed scope is the failure this whole kit
// exists to remove, so reintroducing it one field down would be the worst
// possible bug to ship here.
//
// Whether `branch` is honoured on the https route at all is UNVERIFIED. It is
// documented for the app deep link and absent from the web table, and https
// links open the app when it is installed, so a single-repo link carrying it
// may be honoured on a phone and ignored in a browser. It is emitted for the
// single-repo case on that reasoning: an ignored parameter costs nothing, and a
// missing one cannot be honoured anywhere.
//
// ── The size ceiling, chosen rather than measured ──────────────────────────
//
// A prompt over PROMPT_MAX does not ride in the query string. The number is a
// judgement, and saying which kind of number it is matters more than the digit:
// the one PUBLISHED truncation point is ~14,000 characters, and that is
// documented for Claude Desktop's `q`, not for the web `prompt`. Nothing states
// the web ceiling.
//
// 6,000 leaves room for the encoding rather than for the text. Percent-encoding
// prose runs well over one byte per character once newlines, quotes and any
// non-ASCII are in it, so 6,000 characters of spoken notes can reach 9-10K
// encoded and still sit under the only ceiling anyone has written down.
//
// To replace the guess with a measurement, send a prompt of known length
// carrying position markers and read off where it cut. Until someone does,
// this stays a conservative default and says so.
//
// ── prompt_url, and why nothing here reaches for it ────────────────────────
//
// The documented escape hatch for a long prompt is `prompt_url`, a URL the
// composer fetches, which must allow cross-origin requests. raw.githubusercontent,
// jsDelivr, this repo's Pages origin and gist.githubusercontent all send
// `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so the mechanism works.
//
// This kit will PASS one through and will never MINT one, and the division is
// deliberate. A private repo has no CORS-open raw URL (its raw links carry a
// short-lived token and expire), so minting one from private material means
// publishing that material to an unlisted gist, which is world-readable to
// anyone holding the address. That is a disclosure decision and it belongs to a
// caller that can put it in front of a person, never to a link minter.
//
// The pressure to reach for it is also lower than it looks. Claude Code CLONES
// the repository, so a prompt aimed there wants ADDRESSES, not content: a path,
// a ref, a selector, a line range, and the session fetches the rest with
// credentials the link never had. Carrying a payload is the CHAT case, where
// there is no repo access, and the chat targets have no prompt_url at all.

  //
  // Gemini is here and unreachable on purpose. gemini.google.com accepts no

  // Studio takes `model` and `grounding` but not a prompt. Recording that here
  // is worth more than omitting the row: a later session asking "why is there no
  // Gemini button" gets the answer instead of re-running the search.
