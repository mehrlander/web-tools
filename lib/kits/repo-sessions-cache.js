// Sessions aggregate for the web-tools ecosystem. The private registry holds one
// JSON record per Claude Code session under `sessions/YYYY/MM/`, written by the
// Stop hook while the session runs (web-tools-private/sessions/README.md). This
// folds them into one small cache file (state/sessions.json) that the estate's
// Sessions view renders.
//
// It exists for the same reason state/activity.json does, only more sharply. The
// store is 4.6 MB across 40 records and grows by about six records a day, and a
// single record runs to half a megabyte because it carries every tool call. No
// view can read that on open. Measured on the first live crawl (2026-08-05, 42
// records): the whole cache is 135 KB, about 1 KB a row, so it is smaller than
// the largest single record and 34x smaller than the store. The full record is
// fetched only when a reader opens one.
//
// The crawl is incremental in a way the config and activity crawls cannot be: a
// published record is addressed by a git blob sha, so a crawl re-summarizes only
// the records whose sha moved. In steady state that is the day's handful plus the
// live session's own record, which rewrites on every Stop.
//
// Three rollups ride the cache, all folded from the rows so a reader pays for
// none: `attention` (the busiest files across sessions, the Sessions pane's
// panel), `docAttention` (the same fold over the docs/ slice, which the Map
// view's Docs tab renders as each document's readership), and
// `startupAttention` (what was in context before the conversation began,
// which is presence rather than access and is folded separately for that
// reason: the two must never be summed).
//
// The fold takes a SECOND input beside the records: a dated export of the
// claude.ai/code sidebar, which is the only place a session's real title exists
// in a form the estate can read. See "The real title, joined from a dated
// export" below, and web-tools-private sessions/README.md for why a record can
// never carry one itself.
//
// Pure builders live here so they can be unit-tested; the network crawl and the
// throttle that drive them live in the show-repo shell (refreshSessionsCache),
// exactly as repo-activity-cache.js splits pure fold from shell crawl. Attaches
// to window.RepoSessionsCache, loaded via gh.load('kits/repo-sessions-cache.js').

  //
  // Whole is safe because the RECORD already bounds it. The recorder caps
  // prose at 8 KB a turn, and measured over the 233 replies on file
  // 2026-08-27 the longest is 7,453 characters with nine over 5,000 and none
  // over 10,000. Median 746, which is why the 600 cap was cutting half of them
  // by a sentence or two and buying almost nothing. Carrying every one whole
  // costs 231 KB across the store.
  // The summarizer's own version, carried on every row. A crawl refetches a
  // record whose row was built by an older summarizer, so adding a field here
  // heals the cache on the next pass instead of leaving the new field empty for
  // every record whose blob sha never moves again. Bump it when summarize()
  // starts reading something it did not read before.
  //
  // 5, NOT 4, and the reason is worth keeping. Two branches added fields at the
  // same time (docShell on one, reply on the other) and each bumped 3 to 4, so
  // the merge produced one summarizer reading both and a version that only says
  // ONE of them was added. A row is stale against a new field and its record's
  // sha will never move again to say so, which makes this number the only
  // signal there is; two independent additions sharing it defeats it silently.
  // The rule the collision teaches: on a merge, take a number NEITHER side
  // used, and never assume an identical bump on both sides is agreement.
  //
  // 6 adds `turns`. It landed before the store had finished healing to 5, so
  // the two fields arrive together on one pass rather than costing two: a
  // crawl reads SESSIONS_MAX_FETCH records and a row behind on either version
  // is refetched by the same check.
  //
  // 9 is the first bump for a CAP rather than a field: PROMPT_HEAD went from
  // 120 to 240 (see the cap notes below), so an old row's user turns are cut
  // shorter than a new one's with nothing in the text to say which. That is
  // exactly what this number is for, and the card already reports it: a row
  // behind the current version renders its `staleV` note.
  //
  // 10 adds `state`, and it is the one bump so far that a reader can SEE
  // waiting: the row draws a glyph for its closing state, so an unhealed row
  // draws an empty slot beside rows that carry one, and until the pass lands
  // that reads as "this session said nothing" rather than "not summarised
  // yet". One crawl of the store settles it.
  //
  // 11 adds `states` and `statesCut`, the sequence behind that one glyph. It
  // rides in the SAME crawl as 10 if the store has not finished healing, which
  // is why the two are one pass apart rather than one release apart: a row
  // behind on either version is refetched by the same check.
  //
  // 12 adds `gap` to each state, the prompts between it and the one before.
  // Same pass again: nothing has crawled since 10, so a store healing now
  // picks up all three at once.
  //
  // 13 widens `startup` from `[path, basis]` to
  // `[path, basis, via, delivered, sent]`, which is what lets
  // `injectionAcross` below answer whether the injector delivers what it was
  // built to deliver. The unhealed case is visible and honest rather than
  // wrong: a row at 12 carries no `via`, so it counts toward the sessions
  // scanned and contributes no document, and the fold reports both numbers.
  //
  // 14 adds `startupCut`, from record schema 7, and it is the sharpest of the
  // set: every field above reports what the injector SUPPLIED, and this reports
  // whether the session got it. Same pass as 13 for a store healing now.
  //
  // 15 adds `skillCalls`, the one channel above that is not a file. Every field
  // to here counts a document being OPENED, and a skill is not opened: the
  // harness loads its body on invocation, leaving no entry in `files` at all.
  // Reading a skill's readership out of `files` therefore measures sessions
  // that EDITED it, which is the wrong number wearing the right label: measured
  // 2026-08-30, daisy-alpine's SKILL.md showed one session and zero reads,
  // while the skill had actually fired in four. Invocation is recorded, just
  // somewhere else, so this reads it from there. No record is re-instrumented
  // and nothing is captured that was not already stored.

  // row that answers "does this still need me" without opening anything.
  //
  // A DIFFERENT AXIS from the outcome rail, which rolls up what became of the
  // session's BRANCHES. A session can leave every branch merged and still close
  // 🟢 with work named for the next go, or close ⚪ having opened no PR at all.
  // The rail reads GitHub; this reads the session.
  //
  // THE NEWEST REPLY THAT CARRIES ONE, not the last reply, and the difference
  // is most of the signal. A session subscribed to its own PR wakes on the
  // merge and answers the event, so the final reply is routinely "nothing to
  // act on" plus the post-merge footer, with the state one or two turns above
  // it. Measured 2026-08-28 over the 238 records on file: the last reply alone
  // finds 148, scanning back finds 183, and over the ten days to 2026-08-28 the
  // scan finds one on every record (102 of 102). The 55 misses are July, before
  // the convention, and schema-1-to-3 records that kept only a 500-character
  // tail of the final turn.
  //

  // published as a bulleted list, and a list marker fails this pattern. Four of
  // the 183 carry more than one candidate line and the LAST wins, which is
  // where a closing state sits (median 84% of the way into its reply).
  // The pattern and the glyph-to-key table now live in kits/closing-state.js,
  // which this loads ahead of. They were here because this was the first thing
  // to need them, and the renderer's glyph-and-gloss half was in estate.js for
  // the same reason: two owners of one vocabulary, neither able to see the

  // work, and the glyph on a row is the LAST frame of that sequence. Measured
  // 2026-08-28 over the 183 records that carry any: median 12 states each,
  // mean 14, max 56, and 180 of the 183 CHANGE state at least once. So the
  // history is the substance and the single value is its tip, which is why
  // this returns the list and closingState reads the end of it rather than
  // scanning on its own. One parser, one answer.
  //
  // A state's MESSAGE is the passage from its marker line to the end of that
  // reply, which is what the convention writes: a marker, a bold lead, and the
  // sentences that say what it means here. Everything above it in that reply
  // is the work being reported, and the card that renders these is not a
  // transcript of the session.
  //
  // CARRIED WHOLE, which is the one place this parts company with `turns`, and
  // the numbers are why. A closing state is a marker, a bold lead and two or
  // three sentences: measured over the 1,703 passages the cap keeps, median
  // 333 characters and p90 622. Heading the priors at TURN_HEAD cut 68% of
  // them, so two thirds of the card was a teaser for text that would have
  // fit. Whole costs 675 KB across the store against 431 KB headed, and a cap
  // anywhere useful saves nothing: 1200 still costs 656 KB.
  //
  // So one cap, at 2000, and it is a SAFETY BOUND rather than a head. It
  // leaves 99% untouched and exists for the tail (the longest on file is
  // 5,093), where one entry would otherwise be a wall inside a card of twelve.
  // What it cuts is reported on the turn, as every other cut here is.

  // kept state and this one, which is the one fact that tells two identical

  // session that closed, was answered, and closed again are the same two
  // markers and completely different shapes.
  //
  // Measured 2026-08-28 over the 2,411 consecutive pairs in the store: 15% sit

  // ── The scroll back: what was said on the way here ────────────────────────
  // `reply` is how the session closed. This is everything before it that a
  // reader would have read, so the card scrolls back through the conversation
  // instead of showing one paragraph and stopping.
  //
  // WHICH TURNS, and this is where the card parts company with the deck on
  // purpose. An assistant turn immediately followed by tool calls is work in
  // progress: the sentence that announces a step, or the running report between
  // two of them. The deck keeps the longer ones of those, because a deck is a
  // READING surface and a 400-character progress note is worth reading in a
  // slide with room for it. This is a SCAN surface, two or three lines a turn,
  // and there a progress note is noise: measured on one real record, seven of
  // the fourteen turns the deck expanded were narration clustered just over the
  // deck's own threshold (309, 317, 330, 359, 387, 412, 677 characters), and
  // cut to a card's width they read as seven fragments.
  //
  // So the rule here is the simpler one: followed by calls means in progress,
  // whatever its length. Across the store that drops 765 turns the deck keeps,
  // and what survives has a 10th percentile of 518 characters, meaning even the
  // shortest tenth of it is a real answer. The card's set is a strict SUBSET of
  // the deck's, never a turn the deck folds, which is what
  // tools/test/session-main-turns.test.mjs holds.

  // The three caps, and each answers a different question.
  //
  // TURN_HEAD is the opening of a turn, not the turn. Whole sentences while
  // they fit, so an entry ends where a thought does rather than mid-word; a
  // first sentence longer than the cap is cut at a word boundary and marked
  // with an ellipsis. 240 is two or three lines at the card's width.
  //
  // PROMPT_HEAD was 120 on the argument that an ask here is STRUCTURE, not
  // content: it separated one exchange from the next and the full opening ask
  // was on the row anyway. That was true of a column of replies and stopped
  // being true when the card became a transcript, where the ask is the half a
  // reader scans for and a truncated one is the half that costs them the
  // thread. Measured 2026-08-28 over the 3,186 user turns in 235 records:
  // 120 cut 56% of them, 240 cuts 36% for 159 KB across the store, and 320
  // buys only 7 points more for another 88 KB. So 240, which is also
  // TURN_HEAD: the two ends of an exchange are now cut to one length.
  //
  // TURNS_KEPT bounds the field, and it is the NEWEST that survive: a reader
  // scrolling back goes backwards from the end. Truncation is REPORTED
  // (`turnsCut`), because the store's own schema-5 lesson is that a bound is
  // fine and a silent one is the damage.
  //
  // 60, and the number came off the curve rather than a guess. Measured
  // 2026-08-27 over 229 records: the MEDIAN row costs 2,079 bytes at every cap
  // from 40 upward, and is unchanged by removing the cap entirely, because the
  // median session has 17 entries. All the cost is in the tail. So the cap buys
  // nothing from the typical row and everything from the worst: at 20 it cut
  // 97 rows to fund a store of 410 KB; at 60 it cuts 20 rows for 651 KB; with
  // no cap at all one 144-entry session reaches 18,769 bytes on its own for a
  // store of 710 KB. 60 leaves 91% of rows whole and still bounds the outlier,
  // which is what a cap is for.

  // - **It is applied to every row on every fold**, not only to the records a
  //   pass re-read. A row's blob sha never moves again once its session ends,
  //   so a title joined inside summarize() would reach only the handful of
  //   records the crawl happened to refetch and would need a ROW_V bump and a
  //   full re-crawl to reach the rest. Applied here it costs nothing and no
  //   version bump.
  // - **A missing export costs accuracy, not function.** `titles` of null
  //   leaves every row's `title` exactly as the previous cache had it, so a day
  //   the desktop slept shows yesterday's titles rather than a page of blanks.

  // One session as a block of text, for pasting somewhere the session is not.
  //
  // Two readers want this and they cannot use the same line. A PERSON, later,
  // wants something tappable plus enough label to know which session it is
  // before tapping. Another SESSION cannot open a browser page at all: what it
  // can do is read the record out of the store checkout, or run search.py
  // against it.
  //
  // They do not fork, because the short id is already the join key across all
  // three surfaces: it is the record's own filename stem, the argument
  // `search.py --show` takes, and the address pages/session.html accepts as
  // `#id=`. So one block serves both readers, and everything past the id is
  // legibility.
  //
  // The ask is a LABEL, not a summary, and the block is written so it reads as
  // one. It is the OPENING ask, capped at 240 characters by the summarizer, and
  // a long session routinely ends up somewhere else entirely; the derived name
  // and the repos ride on the first line rather than behind it for exactly that
  // reason.
  //
  // Nothing here is fetched or stored: every value is already on the row, which
  // is what makes this a fold rather than a feature. The duration is the one
  // exception, passed in as a label, because how long a session reads as is a
  // display decision and the shell already owns it (estate.js durLabel).
