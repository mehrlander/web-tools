  // The text and byte savers below differ only in how they reach this base64.
  //
  // The instance's ref names the branch the write lands on: reads always
  // honored it (gh.get sends ?ref=) while the PUT silently omitted `branch`
  // and landed on the default, so a GH pointed at a branch read one thing and
  // wrote another. Fixed 2026-08-08 for the stage's deposit-to-branch send;
  // an empty ref keeps the old default-branch behavior.
  //
  // The first conflict is the common case (no SHA in hand, or a stale one) and
  // recovers immediately; conflicts past that mean the branch is taking other
  // commits right now, and one immediate retry loses that race often enough to
  // surface (the registry repo takes a commit on every session Stop, and its
  // cache saves were failing against exactly that traffic). So later attempts
  // back off briefly before refetching, and the whole thing gives up after
  // PUT_TRIES rather than looping against a hot branch.
  //
  // The refetch MUST bypass the HTTP cache, and for a year it did not. GitHub
  // caches an API read for 60 seconds in the browser, so the recovery re-read
  // the very sha that had just been rejected, PUT_TRIES times, and threw. The
  // retry loop looked sound and was inert. Measured 2026-08-13; the full
  // account is on GH.FRESH in gh-api.js, which is what this passes.
  // Six rather than four, with the backoff reaching seconds rather than one, and
  // the reason is a layer below the HTTP cache: GitHub's contents API is
  // read-after-write EVENTUAL, so the recovery read can be answered by a replica
  // that has not seen the commit yet and hands back the sha that was just
  // rejected. No cache header reaches that. Patience is the only lever this file
  // has, and it is the weaker of the two: a caller that knows the sha it wrote
  // should pass it (see `opts.sha` below and lib/kits/last-write.js), which
  // needs no read at all.
  // The recovery needs ONE FACT, the blob sha, and used to buy it with the whole
  // file. Measured 2026-08-17 off the crawl's own call log: a single activity
  // refresh read `state/activity.json` eleven times for 7.2 MB, and five of
  // those reads were this recovery fetching 370 KB to look at 40 characters. The
  // parent directory's listing carries every entry's sha and none of their
  // bytes, so the same recovery costs about a kilobyte. Falls back to the file
  // read when there is no directory to list or the listing does not name it.
