// The stage: a cross-repo fileset staged for action (view, copy out, send to
// a repo). This component is the BENCH, the working half of show-repo's Stage
// view: it mounts once, fixed at the top of that view, above the rest of
// saved surfaces the estate component renders below it. One stage above any
// repo, beside Repos, since staged items each carry their own origin and the
// set never belonged to the open repo. The link is the
// transport: a #stage= fragment names a set of refs and opens the view
// preloaded with them. Ref content stays behind the viewer's token; PASTED
// text does not, and rides the link itself under &gz= (gzipped, base64url,
// budgeted by GZ_MAX). So a stage of pasted text alone opens for a reader with
// no token and no access to any repo, which is what tools/test/stage-gz-review.mjs
// holds with api.github.com blocked outright.
//
// Takes from: upload (drop-zone), a repo (the path-picker grab row here, or
// the + on Files rows while visiting a repo), #stage= links, and manifest
// stage.files seeds. Puts to: clipboard (the concatenated bundle), a repo
// (send), with bundle download as the clipboard's fallback. Reading is inline;
// it does not route through any repo's Files view.
//
// A staged item is one of two kinds. A REF ({repo, ref, path}) points at a
// file that already lives in a repo; the bundle fetches it and the transfer
// copies it. A LOCAL item ({local:true, name, bytes|text}) is a file dropped
// straight into the stage, its bytes held in memory. Both ride the one stage
// array and both flow through the one "Copy to repo" deposit: refs via
// gh.copyTo, local bytes via gh.saveBytes/save. A local item's BYTES cannot
// serialize, so a binary one is left out of the link and the .web-tools.json
// save; a local TEXT item rides the link under &gz=, and the refusal for a
// binary says which item it was.
//
// Grammar, both directions (StageLink.parseLink / StageLink.mint):
//
//   #stage=owner/repo[@ref]:path1,path2;owner2/repo2:path3[&gz=<b64url>][&prompts=<b64url>][&mode=diff][&cmp=<key>][&view=<name>][&dest=<spec>]
//
// Groups are ';'-separated, paths ','-separated, @ref optional (absent means
// the source repo's default branch). Paths are URL-encoded per component with
// '/' left readable.
//
// A link is one object with four parts: REFS (the stage spec above), CONTENT
// (an optional &gz=, the pasted text items gzipped), COMMENTARY (an optional
// &prompts=, a base64url'd JSON list of {label, ask} review asks), and INTENT
// (&mode=diff to open as a diff run without a click, plus &cmp= and &view= for
// which pair and which reading, and &dest= to aim the send field). Refs are
// pointers, so their content stays behind the token; everything else is
// authored or carried, so it rides the link itself. mint() serializes from
// that object and mintWithLocals() folds the pasted text in (async, since gzip
// is); parseLink() returns { items, gz, prompts, mode, cmp, view, dest }, and
// the bare parse() keeps returning just the items for callers (the shell seed)
// that only want refs. This is the "surface" schema it was the seed of: the
// same shape a manifest's stage block or a standalone surface file would carry.

// The Diff lens's review-prompts panel: a fixed set of general review asks,
// shown once a diff has run. Each copies the two compared texts plus the
// diff, with that prompt's specific ask appended, for pasting into a
// separate chat as a second, independent review. Bespoke (document-specific)
// prompts ride the stage link's &prompts= commentary (see StageLink); the
// panel shows those first, then this fixed set.

  // out and use, and copying out is the whole errand. Markdown renders the same
  // links as a tappable list (READ_MODE sends `.md` to preview), its raw mode is
  // `- [text](url)` lines that paste anywhere, and unlike the csv it generalizes
  // past links, because markdown is what ANY html is worth converting into.
  //
  // THE HOST BRINGS THE LIBRARY, the same contract the transform workbench
  // states: this owns the decisions (which options, which plugins) and throws
  // rather than fetching, because a lazy fetch inside a tap spends the gesture
  // and then reports the loss as something else. Turndown rather than a
  // hand-rolled walk, since nested lists, code blocks, emphasis and the
  // difference between a `<br>` and a paragraph are a tarpit a 27 KB library is
  // already out of; the GFM plugin is what turns a pasted web-page TABLE into a

             The two panes below split on the WINDOW until this is here, and
             the window is the wrong question the moment the deck docks: the
             dock narrows this pane through --deck-dock-left and leaves the
             window where it was, so a 1440px window with a 368px pane still
             matched xl: and laid out a 26rem aside inside it. The aside then
             overflowed the pane by 24px and painted over the deposit column,
             which reads as the whole view collapsing on itself. Same fix and
             same reason as the Docs tab (PR #480, map.js). -->

               surface, says which one. A title here would be the second copy.
               The stage-wide actions sit on the thing they act on.

               NO EMPTY-STATE DROP BOX. A dashed panel captioned "drop files
               here" stood where the real sections belong, and it was a
               placeholder in both senses: the whole VIEW takes the drop
               (@drop on the root above), and Add file and Paste live in the
               aside, so the box carried no capability of its own. What it did
               carry was a caption ABOUT the destination, since the
               destination field only appeared once something was staged: the
               stage claimed in prose to be aimed somewhere instead of just
               showing the field. Both sections now render from the start,
               empty, so an aimed stage IS its aim and a reader sees the two
               things a deposit needs (where it goes, what is in it) before
               supplying either. Decided 2026-08-08 from a phone. -->

               absorbed all the extra space while holding one picker and a
               button, and the aside stayed at its narrowest just as the screen
               got widest. The aside is the column with lists in it, so it is

                     other readings of one paste, this offers another TOOL for
                     what was already read, and collapsing the two would make
                     "carried" mean two things. Same grammar though, a chip that
                     costs nothing to ignore, because the answer to "should this
                     go to the workbench" is usually no and a dialog would ask
                     it every time.

                     One row per staged item that qualifies, since a stage holds
                     several and only some are transform-shaped. -->

                <!-- WHAT THE PASTE CARRIED, and which of it you want. One copy
                     out of a spreadsheet puts the cells, an HTML table, and a
                     picture of the range on the clipboard at once; a copy off a
                     web page puts the labels in one flavor and the addresses in
                     another. The stage takes the one it always took and this bar
                     is the choice over the rest.

                     EVERY flavor is listed, the taken one ticked. It listed only
                     the leftovers until 2026-08-28, which made it an ADD list:
                     bringing the html in was one tap and choosing it INSTEAD was
                     a tap plus hunting the text down in the list below. A tick
                     that toggles says both in one control.

                     EACH PILL IS TWO CONTROLS, and the second one is the answer
                     to "which of these do I want" that a title tooltip could
                     never give: an eye that shows the actual bytes, an image
                     drawn rather than described. A tooltip is also nothing at
                     all on a phone, which is where this bar mostly gets read, so
                     the flavor with the addresses in it was unopenable before
                     you committed to staging it.

                     A bar rather than a dialog: the common case is "take the
                     obvious one and carry on", which a modal would tax to serve
                     the rare one, and this row is also the only place that ever
                     says what a copy actually put on the clipboard. -->

                       by one pill per verb.

              <!-- ── Add: three pills ────────────────────────────────────────
                   Browse, Recent, and Search share one corpus (addRoots) and
                   one outcome (a staged ref), but they are not one question.
                   Folding them into a single query box put recent files in the
                   same list as the repos you navigate, and a list that is half
                   "places to go" and half "things that happened" reads as
                   neither. They are three panes behind the app's segmented
                   pill, the same control the Stage, Activity, and Map use.

                   What survives from the one-box build is the part that was
                   actually about cost rather than layout: BROWSE AND SEARCH
                   SHARE ONE TREE CACHE. Entering a repo reads its tree, and
                   Search reads only what is still missing, so browsing pays
                   for searching in advance instead of the two each fetching
                   the same thing. The pill tap is the gate on that cost, which
                   is what a tap is for and what a keystroke is not. -->
