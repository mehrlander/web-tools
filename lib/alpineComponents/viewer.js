  // answer. Markdown renders, JSON gets the tree, delimited data gets the

  // opens as a table, and under the viewer's bare default it opened as text,
  // so the naming did nothing where it mattered most.
  //

  // owns the table and joins those three columns to the tables beside it;

               to "DP-ML…" after the truncation was pointed the right way.
               Wrapping lets the stats drop under the name and hands the name

                 first, the shape alpineComponents/file-review.js already uses
                 for a changed file's row.
                 The shrink FACTORS are what make it safe, and a plain shrink-0
                 on the name was not: a 38-character filename then refused to
                 give up anything and ran straight through the buttons to its
                 right. Weighting the directory at 9999 means it absorbs
                 essentially all of the shrinking, so the name is only ever
                 truncated once the directory is already gone, and it can still
                 be truncated rather than overflowing. The stats hold their

                   cut to the single character "p" and an ellipsis, sitting in
                   front of the filename as though it were part of it. A stub

                 the content. The table mode grew one, carrying a "Header

                 The class is "contents" so the mode's buttons become siblings
                 of the copy and mode buttons and inherit this row's spacing,
                 rather than forming a box inside it. Filled imperatively by a
                 module's after() through ctx.controls, since the controls a table
                 offers depend on a grid that does not exist until Tabulator

      // caller naming the exclusive mode explicitly gets the same answer, so
      // the rule only ever redirects a default.

      // grid can narrow to rows. A module claims by reading the host's options
