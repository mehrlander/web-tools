// alpineComponents/repo-menu.js — one repo's menu, whichever of the two it is.
//
// Reads window.__shell.repoMenuItems, so the host owns which repo the menu is
// about, which list it is showing (menuKind: the repo's actions, or its GitHub
// destinations), and where to put it. In the app one instance serves both
// lists: the Repos row's marker button, the github button beside it, and the
// Activity view's repo chip all fill this same panel.
//
// It is deliberately FLAT and SHORT. An earlier version gave Files and Branches
// chevrons that expanded into the repo's folders and its branch list; both are
// gone, since "what is inside" is a browsing question the sidebar and the Files
// view already answer once you are in the repo. An "Open" row went too: tapping
// the row itself is what opens the repo, so the menu was offering the thing the
// user had just declined to do. What is left is the set of things you do TO a
// repo rather than inside one. No row expands, so no row carries a chevron; a
// row that leaves the app carries an out-arrow.

      description: 'Flat, compact menu for one repo (window.__shell.menuRepo/menuKind): its actions, or its GitHub destinations',

      // Dense on purpose: below the 44 px floor, which is for a COLD target in
      // chrome, where these rows sit inside a panel the pointer has already
      // aimed at and opened. The same reasoning lets path-picker run its option
      // rows and crumbs below full size. .wt-menu-row (the app's <style>)
      // carries the height, 26 px for a fine pointer and 32 px for a thumb, so
      // this panel and the Activity view's branch menu stay one size.
      // FLAT, and back to flat on purpose. The list briefly grew sections, with
      // an indent and a bold head row each, and then the app section lost its
      // children; one section is not a structure, and the styling was carrying
      // a hierarchy that no longer existed. What tells the two apart now is the
      // out-arrow, which is the honest distinction anyway: these rows leave the
      // app and those do not.
      //
      // item.head is what is left of that, and it means only that the row's
      // label is a REPO NAME rather than a phrase, so it is set in mono like
      // every other repo name in the app. One rule survives too, above the
      // first head row, separating the caller's row (which acts on the list you
      // are in) from the destinations below it.
      //
      // item.mark: 'app' draws the app's own mark INLINE rather than as an
      // <img>, and that is the point: an <img> cannot take currentColor, so a
      // file would sit there in brand blue beside a column of muted glyphs and
      // stay blue on hover. Drawn inline with stroke:currentColor it behaves
      // like every Phosphor glyph in the panel, including going primary with
      // the row. It is an OUTLINE rendition of lib/favicon.svg (the filled
      // original): the same hexagon, bore and centre slot, with the slot
      // widened so the two halves still read as < > at 16 px. Change one and
      // look at the other.
      // Two numbers here are both derived from Phosphor rather than guessed,
      // and both were guessed wrong first. The VIEWBOX is padded to 29 units
      // around a 22-unit-wide mark (~76%), because a Phosphor glyph keeps
      // margin inside its own box and a mark drawn edge-to-edge in the same
      // 16 px reads a size larger; the first pass cropped tight at 23 and sat
      // visibly big beside its neighbours. The STROKE is 29 * 16/256 = 1.81,
      // Phosphor's regular weight (a 16-unit stroke on a 256 canvas) carried
      // onto this viewBox; it scales with the box, so the two move together. No backticks in here: this markup is a JS template
      // literal, and one would end it mid-component.
