// alpineComponents/search-view.js — the central file surface.
//
// It began as a search results list and is now the place files are READ, which
// is the same move made twice. The sidebar finder and this view split one job:
// the finder is for JUMPING (few keystrokes, one destination, no controls),
// this view is for INVESTIGATING (parameters, room for many results,
// iteration). The finder's "File contents" gate routes here with the query
// carried over; the header nav's Search entry opens it empty.
//
// WHY THE FILE OPENS HERE. Every repo carried its own Files view (the
// explorer's breadcrumb walk plus the shared viewer), so reading a file meant
// first choosing a repository and then walking a tree, and a hit found here
// bounced into that per-repo surface to be read. But a file is rarely wanted
// as a position in a tree; it is wanted by name, by folder, or by what is
// inside it, none of which a tree navigator answers and all three of which
// this view already does. So the search IS the browse: a query, a repo, a ref,
// and a folder scope are four filters over one list, and the list opens its
// own file. `?view=files` stays exactly as it was for the tree walk that
// wants it.
//
// Three modes, each a mode pill, all served by lib/kits/estate-search.js (one
// implementation, one cache, shared with the finder):
//
//   Names        the repo trees, at any REF (which is what the trees API
//                gives and the code index does not, so this is the lane that
//                reaches branches) and under any folder. It is TWO READINGS
//                of one corpus, and the query box is the switch between them:
//
//                  a query   recursive and flat, every matching path
//                  no query  ONE LEVEL, folders and files, walkable
//
//                The second is the file browser. It has folders in it, which
//                a recursive match structurally cannot, and it is why an
//                empty query here is an answer rather than a miss.
//   Contents     the code-search API. Its limits are the one thing prose still
//                carries under the controls, since no layout can show what a
//                list is missing: default branches only, indexing can lag a
//                push, files over ~384 KB are not indexed, ten calls a minute.
//                Errors surface whole. A folder scope rides as `path:`.
//   Sessions     the captured-records grep (what a record quotes); hits open
//                the Sessions pane's paged reader via web-tools:open-session.
//
// Every run re-executes the search; the caches underneath make re-matching
// cheap, and "Refresh caches" (EstateSearch.reset) is the explicit way to
// force fresh fetches, which is the view-level answer to "the results seem
// cached". Deep-linkable: the shell stamps
// ?view=search&sq=&smode=&srepo=&sref=&spath=&sfile= through searchSeed, so a
// search AND the file open in it are an address like any other view state.
//
// Mounts by the crumb-bar idiom (template injected in init, then initTree);
// lazy (template x-if="searchSeen" in the shell), like Map and Tools. The
// reader is the shared viewer (viewer.js) embedded with bindStore:false, the
// same way the stage previews a staged file: this view holds cross-repo hits,
// so binding it to the browsed repo's activeFile would be the wrong subject.
