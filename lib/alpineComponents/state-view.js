    // The State view: everything the estate keeps derived, in one list, with
    // its age and the thing that builds it.
    //
    // It exists because "refresh" was one icon over two unrelated verbs. Three
    // caches in the private registry are crawled, committed, and can be hours
    // stale; the search caches and the page itself are recomputed locally and
    // have no age worth reporting. Both wore the same button, in six places,
    // and the reading that tells you whether to press (the as-of) was the part
    // hidden below `sm`. So the chrome kept the control and dropped the fact.
    //
    // Named for what it shows rather than the gesture. The registry's own
    // DESIGN.md splits its contents three ways (authored, derived, captured);
    // this is the derived layer rendered honestly, plus the two local caches
    // that answer the same question and live nowhere. Calling it Freshness
    // would name it after a button the view is meant to retire.
    //
    // FOUR FILES, TWO BUTTONS. state/entities.json is derived like the other
    // three and cannot be refreshed from here: it needs spaCy over ~4,000 files
    // across seven checkouts, about half an hour, which is not a page load. It
    // gets a row anyway, saying so. A freshness surface that lists only what it
    // can fix is the same omission the chrome was already making.
    //
    // Two of the remaining three merged into one press. Branches and Sessions
    // stay two rows over two files, because they are two crawls over two
    // sources with two gates and two histories, and every reading below is
    // per file. They share one Refresh because THE SPLIT IS NOT THE READER'S:
    // a session ending moves both at once, its record landing in the registry
    // and its commits landing on a branch, so a press that got one and left the
    // other was asking about an internal boundary. Grouping keeps both facts,
    // where merging the files would have bought the one button by giving up the
    // per-file account this view exists for.
    //
    // CHECKED VS UPDATED, and the split is the point. `checked` is this
    // browser's stamp from the last time a crawl looked; `updated` is the last
    // commit touching the file. A crawl that ran and found nothing does not
    // commit, so "checked just now, updated 3d ago" reads as current rather
    // than stale, which is exactly what a lone as-of could never say. It is
    // also why `checked` leads: it is the reading the other one cannot stand
    // in for, and it was buried fourth on its line behind two facts nobody
    // needed. The commit date is used rather than the file's own `generatedAt`
    // because reading four generatedAt fields costs 1.5 MB of JSON for four
    // timestamps; for a file only the crawl writes, the commit IS the write.
    //
    // ARRIVING HERE REFRESHES ALL THREE, which is what makes `checked` worth
    // leading with: it is a reading about this visit rather than about whenever
    // some other pane was last opened. The shell's goState does the kicking and
    // carries the argument; what it costs is one call per crawl on a quiet
    // estate, because each crawl gates itself per unit of work.
    //
    // Cost of the view's OWN reading: one `ls state` plus one commit read per
    // file, plus the route manifest the consumer chips are composed from, so
    // six calls, no matter how many repos the estate holds. The local rows need
    // no network.

    // THE PROBE IS GONE, AND SO IS THE CLOCK IT ARGUED WITH.
    //
    // This view used to run a two-call probe and print what it found beside
    // each row: "3 pushed", meaning three repos had been pushed since the
    // cache was built. It was an honest reading and it answered the right
    // question, which is not "how old is this" but "is there anything to
    // fetch". Its flaw was what it did with the answer. Knowing three repos
    // had moved, it lit a button and waited to be pressed.
    //
    // So the reading moved to where it could act. Each crawl now gates itself
    // per unit of work on the same evidence this probe was reading, and the
    // view kicks all three on arrival (goState in the shell). Finding motion
    // and fixing it are one gesture, and the reading a row leads with is what
    // that gesture found rather than what someone might want to do about it.
    //
    // Two things went with it. The staleness verdict, because a row cannot be
    // stale in a view that just refreshed it; and "auto every 30m", which named
    // an interval that never was a schedule (nothing here has ever run on a
    // timer) and is now a sixty-second debounce nobody needs to read.
    //
    // THE SOURCE STRIP: what the SOURCE did, not what the crawl did.
    //
    // A quiet rule from the start of a span to now, one identical tick per
    // event. Time and density are the only encoded variables: within a rail
    // every tick is the same height and the same colour, so a cluster reads as
    // a cluster because the marks overlap and their alpha compounds, never
    // because anything was scaled. A variable-height or heat-mapped version of
    // this would be claiming a magnitude per event that no event here has.
    //
    // ONLY A ROW WITH A TRUTHFUL STREAM GETS ONE. Branches draws commits and
    // Sessions draws sessions at their last active moment, both already dated
    // in their own caches.
    // Repo configs draws nothing: the only timestamps it stores are the crawl's
    // own `at`, so a strip there would be a picture of when the cache was
    // written wearing the label of when the estate changed. That is the one
    // substitution this whole reading exists to refuse, and an empty rail would
    // have been the most convincing way to make it.
    //
    // The rail is drawn whether or not anything happened, since "nothing in the
    // last day" is a reading and a missing rail is not. `partial` marks the case
    // where the underlying list is capped (RepoActivityCache.COMMIT_CAP is 30 a
    // repo) and its oldest event is younger than the window, so the empty
    // stretch on the left is unknown rather than quiet. It is said in the
    // tooltip rather than drawn, because drawing it would need a second visual
    // variable.
    //
    // TWO SPANS AT ONCE, stacked, rather than one span behind a toggle. The
    // rail shipped with a tap that cycled 24h and 7d, on the argument that the
    // label had to state the span anyway so the tap was free. The tap was free;
    // the exclusivity was not. Two questions get asked of this rail, "what
    // happened while I was away this morning" and "has this been quiet all
    // week", and a toggle makes answering either one hide the other, with
    // nothing on screen saying the other exists. They are one reading, so they
    // are drawn together: 7d on top as the context, 24h beneath as the detail.
    //
    // WHAT TIES THE TWO RAILS IS THE CALENDAR, NOT A BAND. The pair shipped
    // with a shaded stretch on the right of the 7d rail marking the slice the
    // 24h rail expands, on the argument that two rows of marks over two spans
    // would otherwise read as unrelated strips. That was true of the rails as
    // they were then, and the day capsules and letters have since taken the
    // job: the last capsule on the week and the day rail below it cover visibly
    // the same ground, and both rails carry the same alternating tone.
    //
    // Removed 2026-08-28, and the reason it had to go rather than merely being
    // redundant: it was drawn in the stream's own colour, which put a magenta
    // block on the Sessions card and nothing legible on Branches, where the
    // same tint sits on blue marks. One element that shouts on one card and
    // vanishes on the other teaches nothing on either. It also put a second
    // fill in the channel the workday band now owns, and two overlapping fills
    // in one channel is how a reader stops being able to name either.
    //
    // Each rail keeps its own linear axis. The alternative was one rail with a
    // break in its scale, a week compressed into the left and a day expanded on
    // the right, which fits in the height of one strip and lies about density
    // at the seam: two marks the same distance apart would mean six hours on
    // one side and forty minutes on the other. Vertical space is the cheaper
    // thing to spend on this card.
    const SPANS = [168, 24];
    // Hours to the shortest true label. 24 stays "24h" rather than becoming
    // "1d", since a day is the unit people say for this window and "1d" reads
    // as a rounding of something; 168 is "7d" to a reader and 168h to nobody.
    const spanLabel = (h) => h >= 48 && h % 24 === 0 ? (h / 24) + 'd' : h + 'h';

    // A COLOUR PER STREAM, and the pairing is locked wherever the two appear
    // together (the house style, "in a comparison, lock each side's treatment across
    // every view"). Branches keep PRIMARY, which is what this rail has always
    // drawn and what the app's accent already means; Sessions take SECONDARY.
    //
    // The comparison is not hypothetical and it is made on this screen. On
    // 2026-08-23 the two rails caught a bug in each other: Branches showed
    // commits 17 minutes old while Sessions claimed two hours of silence, and
    // every one of those commits came from a session Sessions was drawing at
    // its start. That reading is a comparison between two strips, and it was
    // being made in one colour, so which strip a mark belonged to was carried
    // by vertical position alone. Two spans per row doubles the strips and
    // doubles what that ambiguity costs.
    //
    // NOT SUCCESS, AND NOT SECONDARY. Green means one verb on this view (bring
    // this up to date) and is on the Refresh controls and nowhere else, so
    // spending it on a reading would spend the one colour here that still means
    // something.
    //
    // Secondary is taken, and not on this view: `branchTileAccent` fills a
    // MERGED branch tile with it and `BRANCH_STATE_MARK` gives the merge glyph
    // `text-secondary/70`, so secondary already says "merged" on every branch
    // row and every tile nested under a session card. A pair meant to travel
    // cannot start on a colour the destination has already spent, and the
    // destination here is the Sessions pane, where those tiles live. Caught
    // after this shipped in secondary; the check below is so the next one is
    // caught before.
    //
    // Accent is free. It is unused across every component and appears four
    // times in the whole repo, all on standalone pages, and in `winter` it is
    // magenta (oklch hue 335) against primary's blue (258) and success's teal
    // (198), so it is the one token that is both distinct and unclaimed.
    //
    // WHOLE CLASS STRINGS, never assembled from fragments. `'bg-' + tone +
    // '/60'` is invisible to a text scan, which is what the bake-page compiler

    // ONE WEIGHT NOW. This carried two: soft inside the throttle, solid once a
    // row went stale, so the emphasis was a reading rather than decoration.
    // That reading had exactly one basis, the staleness verdict, and gating the
    // crawls on motion removed it: a row on this screen was refreshed on
    // arrival, so there is no "press this one" left to say. A button that
    // escalated on nothing would be the decoration the two weights were
    // introduced to avoid. Ghost while running, for the same reason as before:
    // mid-flight there is nothing to decide.
    //
    // NO OUTLINE. The card is already a bordered box, so an outlined button
    // inside it draws a second rectangle a few pixels in and the eye reads the
    // pair as one fussy frame rather than as a control. Soft carries the colour
    // without the second edge.
    // THE THREE FILE CONTROLS, on every registry row. Expand opens the JSON in
    // the app, History opens the file's change log; the github mark is the way
    // out. Tapping a path used to go straight to GitHub, which is the wrong
    // default for a page whose whole subject is data the app already has a
    // token for and a viewer for.
    //
    // They are captioned carets, not a `{}` glyph. The glyph said "JSON" to
    // someone who already knew, and said nothing to anyone else; expanding a
    // row to see its detail is the gesture people arrive with, so the control
    // should be the one they expect rather than a symbol for the payload.
    //
    // ONE EXPAND, TWO TABS INSIDE IT. This shipped as two carets side by side,
    // Expand and History, on the argument that the bytes and the file's past are
    // different subjects rather than two readings of one thing. Overruled
    // 2026-08-10, and the reason is worth keeping: at the control strip nobody
    // is reading an argument about subjects, they are reading two adjacent
    // disclosure triangles on one row and wondering what the second one does.
    // The distinction was real and belonged one level in, where a tab strip
    // states it in two words and the panel is already open.
    // NO CAPTION ON THE DISCLOSURE. This carried "Expand" closed and "Collapse"
    // open, then "Expand" alone; it carries neither now. A caret at the end of a
    // row is the most established control on the web, the panel it opens is
    // directly beneath it, and every other affordance on this row is already a
    // word, so the caption was the third label competing for a line that has
    // Refresh and a chip strip on it. Size carries it instead.
    //
    // THE GITHUB MARK RIDES THE FILENAME, which is the shell's own convention
    // for a jump-over that names an exact file: the mark sits beside the name it
    // opens (the estate's surface rows, the Map's item rows, the repo dialog's
    // title), tight against it and faint, rather than in a control strip at the
    // far end of the card. It sat with Expand here because the two were read as
    // one group of file controls; they are not, since Expand acts on the panel
    // and this leaves the page.
    //
    // The path itself stays a LABEL. It was an anchor once and that was the one
    // destination a tap on this row should not have, since the whole point of
    // the view is data the app can render itself. The mark beside it is the
    // deliberate, small way out, which is the same split every other call site
    // in the shell draws.
    //
    // AND IT CARRIES A PEEK, which it should have from the start and did not.
    // lib/kits/source-peek.js states the narrow rule: a GitHub icon that names
    // an EXACT FILE carries `data-peek`, one that opens a repo, a branch or a
    // menu does not, and that is what lets a reader tell the four meanings
    // apart. This is the exact-file case. One attribute, no wiring.

             is 16px, explicit or inherited, and this very view's header mark is
             16px, so one screen carried two github marks at two sizes. At 14px
             the glyph's interior detail also muddies, and it is a small target
             on a phone.
             THE NUDGE IS MEASURED, not judged. Centring the glyph box beside
             text aligns two boxes, and a box is not what the eye compares: the
             mono face puts its baseline 3px above its ink bottom, so the
             centred mark hung below the baseline of the name it sits against,
             which reads as sagging. Raising it 1px lands its mass 0.35px off
             the text's x-height centre, and that holds at both sizes. Measured
             off the rendered pixels, glyph forced opaque since a 30%-opacity
             mark defeats an ink threshold; -0.5 and -1.5 render identically to
             0 and -1, so the choice is integers only. -->

    // it exists at this size. The commit list is ONE call per file (the same
    // `history` the row already makes for `built`, asked for twenty rows rather
    // than one), and the magnitude of any one change is two blob reads done
    // only when that row is tapped. Nothing new is written, no schema moves,
    // and the estate gains no artifact to keep in step. The conventions' rule
    // is not to commit what a live read already answers, and the date and the
    // record set are exactly what a live read answers.
    //
    // WHAT IT CANNOT SAY, and where each limit is carried. This shipped as a
    // 40-word paragraph above the rows, stating all of it on every open, and
    // that was the wrong instrument: not over-claiming is a property of the
    // LABELS, while standing prose is insurance against a misreading the labels
    // already prevent. Four of ten visible lines on a phone, read once, noise
    // after. The rule the removal leaves behind: prose in the interface is the
    // expensive fallback for a label that cannot be made honest, and it should
    // be rare.
    //
    //   A run that found nothing leaves no trace, so this counts CHANGES, not
    //   runs. Carried by the summary's own first word, `10 changes`, which is
    //   the whole caveat in one word in the place the eye lands first.
    //
    //   A row is dated when a crawl NOTICED the change, not when it happened,
    //   so a gap bounds the interval rather than measuring it, and the cadence
    //   is partly a fact about the estate and partly about how often the page
    //   was open. This one no label can carry, so it hangs on the gap figure's
    //   own hover, where someone puzzling over a long gap will look.
    //
    // Both are limits of READING rather than writing, and the fix for either is
    // to have the crawl record something. A third limit WAS lifted that way,
    // and it is the exception that shows the rule: duration was nowhere,
    // because the only party that knows it is the browser that ran the crawl
    // and it reported it to a four-second toast, so the crawls now append a
    // `runs` record to the commit they were making anyway
    // (lib/kits/crawl-runs.js). That column needs no note either: a duration
    // shows or it does not, and a row from before the ring shipped carries no
    // figure rather than a zero.
    //
    // THE HEADER IS THE ANSWER MOST OF THE TIME. How often a store really
    // changes, and what a run of it costs, off the list already fetched. It
    // used to print the checking interval beside that, as the reading that said
    // whether the interval was set anywhere near right. There is no interval to
    // judge now: the crawls run when a view that reads them is opened and gate
    // themselves on motion, so how often the store changes IS how often the
    // crawl commits, and the two columns had become one fact.

    // message, landed here.

    // NOT A `state/` FILE, and the row says so by naming its own path. It is an
