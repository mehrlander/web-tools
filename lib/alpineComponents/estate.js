    //               kinds, or curation, just text, done, and an urgent flag
    //               that carries a rail and sorts to the top).

    //               The trio reads as a gradient of commitment: a jot is

                         Two controls, and the pair is the whole navigation
                         model this row answers to (2026-08-27): the NAME takes
                         you ACROSS, one branch to the next through the list you
                         tapped in from, and the CARDS button takes you IN, to
                         this branch's files one at a time.

                         The session row carries the same cluster in the same
                         place, and that is the point. The two panes used to
                         implement opposite halves of one model: a branch had
                         the peer swipe and no direct route to its files, a
                         session had the route to its turns and no peer swipe
                         and no in-app brief at all. Neither row could be read
                         by someone who had learned the other.

                         Cards is PRIMARY and it is the only control here now,
                         the one rule branch-brief's own heading row states: one
                         control wears a colour, and it is the one most readers
                         came to use. ph-cards-three is the house glyph for "read
                         these one at a time" on every surface that has one,
                         which is why a second glyph beside ph-files is not
                         the second files icon the density pass rejected: that
                         one would have been a second COUNT. This is a reader.

                         A ⧉ TO pages/branch.html rode beside it from 2026-08-27
                         to 2026-09-04, and it was one destination too many. The
                         page and the takeover are the SAME component with two
                         hosts (branch-brief.js: "Two hosts, one component"), so
                         the row offered branchBrief twice, once under the name
                         and once under an arrow, and offered the files deck
                         once. What the ⧉ carried alone was the hosted ADDRESS,
                         the thing that survives being sent to somebody, and that
                         is minted in a caption rather than tapped out of a list:
                         a reader in the app is already where the link would take
                         them. Deleting it costs a route to the address, never
                         the address. -->

                       ahead of them overflowed (the route chips, on the one repo
                       that has them) they dropped to a line of their own and
                       sat there right-aligned against nothing. A reader loses a
                       row's shape when its rightmost fact moves.

                       The left box wraps within itself and the right box never
                       shrinks, so the arrows hold the right edge on the first
                       line at every width. The route chips then do what the
                       reader asked for without being told: they stay inline on
                       a desktop, where there is room to spare, and fall to a
                       second line on a phone, where there is not. One rule, two

                         as is known about this branch's files.

                         TWO numbers, and the same two on every row: how many
                         files this branch changed, and how many of them are new.
                         Both are free, since the crawl compares every open PR
                         head against its default for the ahead/behind pair and
                         every file in that response carries a status and a line
                         count. A row with stranded content adds one more thing,
                         the missing count in amber, which opens the pane already
                         filtered to those files.

                         Two is the row's budget, so removals, renames and the
                         line totals live in the hover, which is a small table
                         rather than a sentence. Those are the numbers a reader
                         wants once, not the ones they scan a list for.

                         The landed RATIO used to ride here too, so a scanned
                         row read 28/80 landed 11 missing * while an unscanned
                         row read nothing at all: four mono elements on the busy
                         rows, none on the quiet ones, and no column a reader
                         could scan. The ratio is a verdict and this is a route,
                         so the verdict moved to where there is room to state it
                         whole (the hover, and the Files pane's own strip, which
                         names all three classes). What stays on the row is the
                         count every row can carry and the one flag worth
                         raising unasked.

                         The asterisk is the no-merge-base caveat, and it covers
                         both numbers: there the compare fell back to the
                         branch's recent history, so the counts span more than
                         the branch itself. -->

                           could never be: one string, in the browser's type, with
                           no links in it. Hovering opens on a fine pointer and
                           tapping opens everywhere, so the card is the row's
                           destination on a phone too; the branch name still opens
                           the detail, and the card carries a second route to it.

                           New files are GREEN, and green now means exactly this
                           everywhere on the row. It used to tint the whole
                           control when the scan found nothing missing, a signal
                           the absent missing count and the Landed chip were
                           already carrying twice over; spending it here is what
                           lets a file-plus glyph read as a different thing from a
                           files glyph at eighteen pixels. The row's palette is
                           one idea: neutral changed, green added, amber

                         It used to ride the identity row, right-aligned past
                         the lifespan. It read fine there and cost the one
                         thing that row cannot spare: the NAME, which both
                         identifies the row and opens its brief.

                         Down here it sits among the other icon buttons, where
                         a reader already looks for something to press, and the
                         identity row goes back to being identity. The session
                         row moved its own the same way in the same commit,
                         which is the whole point: one rule, both rows.
                         Measured at 430px, where the session title had been
                         truncating to show-rep… to pay for its cluster.

                         LAST of the row's FIXED items, after the counts and the
                         Stage: facts first, then what acts, the same rule the
                         session row follows. Leading was tried first and
                         rendered; it works and puts the press before the facts,
                         which is not how either row is read. The route chips
                         are the one thing behind it, on the argument their own
                         comment makes below: they are the only item whose width
                         is a branch's data rather than a constant.

                         ONE control, so no cluster to hold together. Two of
                         them travelled in a span, because loose in the wrapping
                         flex they broke apart at 430px and a cluster that
                         splits is not a cluster; the span went with the ⧉,
                         since a span around one button is a wrapper with
                         nothing to wrap.

                         A flex-and-center class pair is what puts the GLYPH on
                         the line rather than merely the button, and no backtick
                         may name it here: this markup is a JS template literal
                         and one would end it mid-component, which is the same
                         trap the Claude-mark comment above records.
                         A bare button is a BLOCK
                         box, so its icon is an inline box baseline-aligned
                         against the button's own strut and sits at the top of
                         it: measured 2026-09-04 at 430px, this glyph's centre
                         was 3px above every other icon on the row while its
                         button box was centred correctly. Every neighbour here
                         is a flex container for the same reason, and the larger
                         font size (text-xl against text-lg) is what made this
                         the one that showed it. -->

                         cannot disagree: a hit on a narrow carrier is ON the

                         and reads ghosted, and the shell never counts.
                         Absent, not empty, for every repo but the hub: routes
                         are one page in one repo and a row from another has no
                         answer here rather than a null one. A tap opens the
                         route, which is the join made useful rather than
                         merely shown.

                         LAST, and it is the only item on this line that earns
                         its position by WIDTH rather than by what it says.
                         Everything ahead of it is a fixed handful of glyphs;
                         this is a chip per route, and a branch touching one
                         widely declared file draws one for each route that
                         declares it (seven, today, for
                         lib/alpineComponents/estate.js, which is the file most
                         of this pane's own work touches). Ahead of the cluster
                         those chips took the rest of the line at 430px and
                         pushed the cards button and the branch-page link down
                         below them, so the row's two controls moved with a
                         neighbour's data. Behind it they wrap under a line
                         whose shape is already settled, and nothing follows

                 Account is the one thing the retired header shield did that no
                 per-repo surface covers, naming the identity in play and letting
                 you replace or clear the token. It belongs to the account, so it
                 sits on the account's own view (Repos, the dashboard) rather than

                 The second is the AGE of what these cards are drawn from: the
                 config cache. It used to be a Refresh button with no reading

                 enough to re-crawl?") while withholding the only fact that
                 answers it. The pill states the age and opens State, where the
                 crawl is one tap away with its cost and throttle named. The
                 shield's estate panel held the old button, which is why

          <!-- ── Activity pill row ─────────────────────────────────────────
               Branches / Sessions are the two readings of one fact: what the
               estate is working on, and the work that made it. A branch is
               the artifact and a session is the act, they cross-reference
               each other, and neither is complete alone. This segmented pill
               (the shared internal-tab style) switches between them, each
               carrying its live count. Switching routes through the shell's
               go* methods, so the URL keeps stamping the specific sub-view
               and existing ?view=activity links keep resolving. The as-of +
               Refresh pair rides the row's right side and belongs to whichever
               pill is lit, since each pane has its own cache and its own crawl.

               To-do and Jot used to be the third and fourth pills here and are
               now the Lists stop. They were a gradient of commitment from a
               captured idea to work in flight, which read well and was still
               wrong: a personal checklist is not the estate's activity, and
               keeping them here cost the two panes that ARE the full column.

               The pill runs at EVERY breakpoint. It used to be the
               narrow-screen form only: on lg+ the set rendered side by side,
               the main column plus a 24rem right rail. That rail held its
               width whether or not it had anything in it, which is a standing
               claim on the page's one scarce axis. One tab at full width, at
               any size, is the same trade the phone was already making. -->

               class="flex items-center gap-2 mb-4 flex-wrap">
            <!-- No counts on these pills. The Branches badge read
                 openBranches.length, which is the SCOPED list, so it moved with
                 the scope chip and reported "98" for Recent while the estate
                 held 222 branches. A number in a tab is read as that tab's
                 total, and this one never was. The counts that are honest are
                 already one row down: a per-scope count on every chip, and the
                 window row's "N of M". Dropping them also gives the row back
                 the horizontal space it was wrapping for on a phone. -->
            <!-- w-fit + flex-wrap, the Map strip's treatment, now shared by

                 at its intrinsic width and, with nothing inside able to wrap,
                 a fifth pill went off the right edge of a phone rather than
                 onto a second line. Measured on a 390 px screen the moment
                 Routes shipped: "Branches Sessions Guides Chats Ro—". A tab
                 you cannot reach is not a tab. The wrap costs nothing where
                 the row fits, which is why it belongs on every such row rather
                 than on the one that happened to overflow first. -->

                   session's branches, so the flat list was one tap deeper and

                   answer different questions and only one of them is about
                   sessions: the branch scopes (Open, Stranded, Landed,
                   Abandoned) are a cleanup pass over the estate's branches,
                   and a lens inside a session list is the wrong place to run
                   it. Second, not first, because the session is the act and

                         column that jitters is not one the eye can run down,
                         which was the only reason to draw it. See
                         SESSION_STATE for what it reads and why it is a glyph
                         rather than a fourth use of colour.

                         IT OPENS THE SEQUENCE, and that is the whole reason it
                         became a control after shipping as a span. A session
                         closes at the end of every stretch of work, not once:
                         median 12 states a record over the 183 that carry any,
                         and 180 of them CHANGE state at least once. So the
                         glyph is the last frame of a history, and tapping it
                         opens that history in the prose card the ask line
                         already opens, newest first with the earlier ones a
                         scroll up.

                         Its native title went with the change. A title attribute and a
                         styled card fire on one hover and say different
                         things, which is the exact failure the rail's legend
                         made and the day is now carrying: two tooltips, one
                         gesture. What the note said is in the card.

                         Padded past the glyph with a negative margin, so the
                         target is a finger without the column moving. Two
                         characters is the tap size this row's own comments
                         complain about, and it was the argument for leaving
                         this a span. -->

                         failure rail.

                         It carried the id's weight until 2026-08-28, in second
                         place and at /70, which put the boldest thing on the
                         row on eight hex characters that distinguish sessions
                         from each other and describe none of them. A list is
                         scanned for the one about the submittal labels, so the
                         name reads first and the id follows as the address it
                         is. Both still open the session, which is what made
                         the swap free: the pair is an identifier and a label,
                         and only their order and weight moved. -->

                         search.py --show takes and what the pointer block
                         copies. Demoted to the day's weight, since the two are
                         one string split around the name, and the title says
                         the filename whole so the split costs nothing.

                         It takes the bold back where a row has no name at all:
                         a session that never got a branch has nothing else to
                         be called, and an unemphasised id under a blank would
                         leave the row with no identity in the type.

                         AND IT GOES AWAY ON A PHONE, on the same argument the
                         day makes three lines up: eight fixed mono characters
                         is 85px of a 430px row spent on the token that
                         distinguishes sessions rather than the one that
                         describes them, and it was the name truncating to pay
                         for it. The address stays one tap away either way, on
                         the two controls in the trailing cluster: the arrow
                         opens session.html at this id and the clipboard writes
                         the pointer block that names it.

                         Unless there is no name, which is the row that has
                         nothing else to be: there the id stays at every width,
                         because the alternative is a row of a date and a
                         duration. -->

                         branch": it leaves the reader in a different pane with
                         the branch still to find, and it loses the session they
                         were reading. A session's branch is also frequently
                         merged and so absent from that list entirely, which the
                         old filter could not express at all. -->

                         number is the key the list is sorted on, and it was the
                         one fact the row did not show. Ordering by it while
                         displaying a duration left a list whose order could not
                         be read off it, which is what sent a reader looking for
                         a bug on 2026-09-04: three rows, descending durations,
                         and no way to see that the order was right.

                         It REPLACES the duration rather than joining it. Two
                         durations side by side are not distinguishable at a
                         glance, and the row's width is already spent (the name
                         truncates at 430px, which every comment above is about).
                         The exact minutes stay one hover away in the title, and
                         the span between the two numbers reads as the duration
                         to within its own rounding.

                         Same element, classes and dimming as the branch row
                         below it in the same card, so the two agree. And on the
                         same rule: the start is dropped when it rounds to the
                         same label as the tip, which is a session under an hour
                         and reclaims the width for exactly the rows that have
                         nothing to say with it. -->

                         made room for a third glyph. Left-packed, the icons ate
                         the width the title needs, and the title is now a
                         control: it opens the session's brief, so a reader who
                         cannot read it cannot aim at it. Measured at 430px,
                         where the first row's name truncated to two characters.

                         place, which is the point. Both rows now read
                         identity, then facts, then the two routes out: the
                         NAME goes across the list, the CARDS button goes in. -->

                       while the two smallest things on the line (an 8-character
                       id, a truncated branch name) carried the actions, so the
                       one element that says what the session WAS did nothing
                       when tapped. It opens the conversation, same as the id.
                       A spinner rides here while the record is being fetched. -->
                  <!-- The ask, and it is PROSE. It was a button opening the
                       conversation, on the reasoning that the one element
                       saying what a session WAS should do something when
                       tapped; the two things that acted were an eight-character
                       id and a truncated branch name, and neither is a target
                       on a phone. That argument was about tap size, and the
                       cards button in the cluster above pays it back with a
                       control built for the purpose. The branch row's subject
                       has always been plain for the same reason, and the two
                       rows now agree.

                       IT OPENS NOTHING, and that is a retreat from where this
                       went. The line carried the transcript card for a while,
                       on the pairing argument: the ask says how the session
                       opened and the panel says how it closed, two ends of one
                       session in the space a row already had. What the argument
                       missed is that the transcript is not ABOUT the ask. It is
                       every turn of the conversation, which is what the turn
                       count beside it names, so the count is where it hangs now
                       and this line is what it always looked like, a truncated
                       quotation with the whole of it one tap away.

                       The affordance is not lost, it is one row down and on the
                       glyph that says how many. A line of prose advertising a
                       panel had to invent a signal for itself (cursor-help put
                       a question mark over every ask on the pane, then a hover
                       tint replaced it); a counter beside an icon needs none,
                       because every other counter on the row already opens. -->

                         All three used to ride the identity row, right-aligned
                         past the duration. They read fine there and cost the
                         one thing that row cannot spare: the session TITLE,
                         which both identifies the row and opens its brief, and
                         which was truncating to show-rep… at 430px to pay for
                         them.

                         Down here they sit among the other icon buttons, where
                         a reader already looks for something to press, and the
                         identity row goes back to being identity: a day, an id,
                         a name, how long it ran. The branch row moved its own
                         pair the same way in the same commit.

                         FACTS FIRST, then what acts: the counts say how big the
                         session was, the token headline closes them, and these
                         three are what you press. Cards is the primary and sits
                         where the eye lands after reading the numbers; copy is
                         last, being the one nobody reaches for twice.

                         AFTER the token headline, not before it, and the
                         difference is the only reason this line does not break.
                         Tokens carries the ml-auto, so it and these form one
                         right-aligned group: put the actions ahead of it and
                         the auto-margin pushes the tokens onto a line of their
                         own with the three glyphs stranded above. Behind it,
                         the group wraps whole, which reads as a second line of
                         the same thing rather than an orphan.

                         Leading the line was tried first and rendered: it works
                         and it puts the press before the facts, which is not
                         how the row is read. -->
                    <!-- ONE SPAN, so the pair travels together. Loose in the
                         wrapping flex they are two items, and at 430px the line
                         broke between them: cards ended one row and the rest
                         started the next, left-aligned under the counts. A cluster
                         that splits is not a cluster. It held three until the ⧉
                         went (see below), and the span survives the loss because
                         two is still a cluster; the branch row dropped its span
                         at the same time, having been left with one control. -->
                    <!-- THE ONE auto margin on this line, and it moved here from
                         the token headline. Two of them is what put a gap in the
                         middle of the row on a desktop: tokens pushed itself right,
                         then the cluster pushed itself right again, and the figure
                         floated between the counts and the actions with nothing
                         either side. One margin makes the tail a single
                         right-aligned group, tokens included.

                         It also resolves per FLEX LINE, so when the run overflows
                         at 430px the cluster wraps alone and still holds the right
                         rather than falling in under the counts. -->

                     Every fact here is already in the branch cache, so the
                     rows cost nothing beyond the join: state and PR number,
                     the lifespan (first commit → tip), the ahead/behind pair,
                     and the scan's verdict where it ran. -->
                <!-- ── The branches this session left behind ─────────────────
                     Each one is an inset TILE rather than a row behind a rail.
                     A rail was the obvious move and the wrong one: the session
                     card already carries a left rail for its outcome, so a
                     second stripe two pixels inside it read as a stripe pile
                     and said nothing the indent had not. A tile says the same
                     thing by being a surface: it sits in the card the way a
                     branch sits in a session, and it holds a full branch row
                     without the row needing to look like a list item.
                     Measured against four alternatives (rail, hairline rules,

               highlights by PR state (ready / draft / no-PR), states its
               lifespan (first commit → latest), and carries a caption-style
               link cluster: browse the branch here, the guide PR, the Claude
               Code session that authored it, and a GitHub menu for everything

                 This filters rows the crawl already stored; it does not

                 estate is larger than the set with work in flight, and a row
                 of zeroes says nothing), and the row hides entirely below two
                 of them, since a filter with one option is furniture. One
                 insertion serves both breakpoints: the desktop header above is
                 hidden on small screens, so on a phone this lands directly
                 under the Open / To-do / Jots pills. It scrolls sideways
                 rather than wrapping, which is what keeps a second row of
                 controls from pushing the first branch off the screen. -->

               The chat archive as the fourth venue, read one month at a time
               off mehrlander/chat-histories. 14,844 conversations across three
               providers, and this loads none of them until asked: the archive
               is already sharded by month, so the pane opens on the newest
               month and walks back on demand (kits/chat-archive.js).

               The banner is not decoration and not an apology. This is the one
               pane whose subject advances by hand, through an export requested
               on a website and downloaded from an email, so how far behind it
               is IS the state of the venue. It reads the frontier the archive
               generates for itself, which the repo's declared staleness check
               reads too, so the pane and the estate card cannot disagree.

               No refresh control. There is nothing here to refresh: the shards
               are immutable once committed and the frontier only moves when an
               export lands, which is a commit to that repo rather than a crawl
               this page could run. -->

          <!-- ── Routes view (Activity sub-tab) ───────────────────────────
               Every destination the app can be sent to, ranked by when the
               code behind it last moved, with whatever is open against it now.

               WHAT THIS PANE IS FOR. The other four Activity panes are keyed
               to git: a branch, the session that ran it, the body that
               accounts for it. All of them answer "who was working, and
               when". None answers "on WHAT part of the app", and the app is
               where most of the work goes. This is that reading, keyed to the
               address rather than to the commit.

               THE JOIN IS FILES, AND FILES ARE COARSER THAN ROUTES. Nine
               routes render out of estate.js, so a commit there could date all
               nine; the shell holds the router and every pane's outer markup,
               so a commit there would date everything. The kit
               (lib/kits/route-activity.js) handles both by refusing the
               attribution rather than making it: the shell is excluded and
               gets its own row at the foot, and a file carrying three or more
               routes cannot be a row's REASON, only its fallback, in which
               case the row says "shared" beside the date. The exclusions are
               not a limitation the pane hides; they are what it has to show,
               because a route with no narrow carrier is a route with no code
               of its own, and that count is the header's second figure. -->

                 both wrong and in opposite directions. A section per manifest
                 group cost the pane its headline: an hour-old route sat below
                 a six-day-old one because they were in different sections. A
                 flat list fixed that and introduced its own confusion, listing
                 six FOSSIL keys at the same rank as live destinations, since
                 the router addresses Sessions, Chats, Routes, Jot and Saved
                 as their own ?view= key even though each is a sub-tab of
                 something else. (They were all nav stops once; each kept its
                 key when its pane moved under another, so saved links resolve.)
                 Grouping by the declared stop puts that level back, and taking the order
                 from the ranking rather than recomputing it is what keeps
                 freshest-first true at both levels: see the kit. A stop that

               Pin over To-do over Jot, all at once. To-do and Jot were two of
               Activity's pills and they were never activity: a personal
               checklist and an idea pile are things you keep, not the estate
               moving. Combined they are one stop, and combining them is what
               makes the tab unnecessary rather than merely fewer: the reason
               to switch was to see the other one, and now both are on screen.
               Pin rides on top as a compact block rather than a third half;
               its section comment below carries its own design.

               The split is fixed halves, each scrolling INSIDE itself, so
               adding to one never pushes the other off. That needs a definite
               height, which the estate pane hands down through the shell
               (listsFill: the pane and its column go flex + overflow-hidden
               for this view only). Nothing here adds a card, a border box, or
               a second layer of padding: two sections, one hairline between
               them, and the scroll happens on the list rather than the page.

               Each half keeps its own add form and heading pinned while its
               list scrolls, since the add form is the reason you came. -->

                           delete is destructive and unreversible, so hiding it
                           behind hover is worth what it costs a phone, while
                           flagging is one tap either way and a control nobody
                           can reach on a phone is a control that does not
                           exist. Off is a faint outline flag, on is a filled
                           one, the same state-in-the-weight idiom the links
                           page uses for its rail pins. A button is interactive
                           content, so neither one activates the wrapping label
                           the way a tap on the row does. -->

          <!-- ── The file card ────────────────────────────────────────────
               One of the row's two file pairs, opened. Three bands: what it is
               and how many lines, the SHAPE (extensions and top folders, from
               the crawl, so it paints with no call), and the LIST (from the
               compare, fetched on open and shared with the branch takeover
               through the same memo). Each filename opens on GitHub, and the
               footer opens the branch view's Files pane, which is the same
               material with diffs under it.

               Same geometry, hover timings and dismissal as the branch menu
               above, so the two anchored panels in this view behave alike; one
               z-index higher, since opening a card puts the menu away rather
               than the other way round. -->
          <!-- The width is STAMPED, not classed, and it is fit-content rather
               than fixed. Two things wrong with the class it replaces. A prose
               card held a short passage in a box always 35rem wide, so the
               panel was visibly wider than the thing in it; and the number
               lived twice, as a Tailwind arbitrary value here and as
               REPLY_CARD_W in the anchor that places the panel, which is the
               drift the shell's own MENU_W comment was written about after it
               had already happened once.
               Now rowCardStyle stamps both bounds off the one constant, so
               there is nothing to keep in step and nothing that depends on an
               arbitrary class being generated at runtime. -->

                       the session's span rather than evenly, so the rail draws
                       the shape of the conversation: a burst reads as a
                       cluster, an hour away as a gap, and the long tail of a
                       session that ran overnight reads as one.

                       The vocabulary is the State view's pulse rail, down to
                       the rule sitting at the vertical middle with the ticks
                       straddling it and the resolved mark drawn full strength.
                       Same problem, so the same answer: a dense row of marks
                       needs one of them saying which is being described.

                       A CUT FRONT DRAWS ITSELF. The span is the session's, so
                       the opening ask sits at 0 and the kept turns start
                       wherever they start; the empty stretch between them is
                       the middle the card does not hold, which the note above
                       the first turn states in words.

                       AND IT IS A CONTROL. Tapping the rail scrolls to the
                       nearest exchange, which is the one gesture that crosses
                       sixty turns; that is why the whole strip carries the
                       pointer and the padding, rather than each 1px tick. -->

                     The session's opening ask, then what it concluded. The row
                     shows the first and truncates it; this shows both whole,
                     which is the pairing the row was making with a title
                     attribute and could not render: a native tooltip has no
                     type, no scroll, and no way onto a phone.

                     The ask is quiet and the reply is not, because the reply is
                     what the reader opened this for; the ask is context for it
                     and is already on the row above. whitespace-pre-line so a
                     reply written in paragraphs arrives as paragraphs, which is
                     most of what makes this readable rather than a wall. -->

                  <!-- ── The transcript ─────────────────────────────────────
                       Built by chatRender.message, which is the function the
                       swipe deck renders every turn with. Not a lookalike: the
                       same role chrome (icon, mono label, clock), the same
                       coloured left edge per role, the same markdown with
                       fenced blocks promoted to artifacts, and a user turn in
                       monospace because that is how it was typed.

                       This replaced a hand-built body that approximated the
                       deck and got it awkwardly wrong: a truncated ask on a
                       rule, prose through the guide renderer, and no times at
                       all. The lesson is the one the estate keeps relearning:
                       when a reading surface already exists, mount IT.

                       Imperative rather than templated, because the renderer
                       returns elements. x-effect re-runs it whenever the card
                       changes, which is what an Alpine binding would have done

          <!-- The branch detail is no longer markup. Tapping a branch name
               opens a swipe-deck (kits/swipe-deck.js) whose slides each mount
               the branchBrief component directly, so the reader gets the
               platform's own snap gesture: compositor-threaded, with momentum,
               interruptible mid-fling, and with the neighbouring branches
               really there under the finger rather than a single surface
               translated over a blank panel.

               What that replaced, and why the subtraction is the argument:
               about 540 lines here (a bespoke overlay, a hand-rolled
               touchstart/move/end drag, a two-phase commit animation, an
               instant facts card, a frame reference, a postMessage channel)
               plus 165 in branch-brief.js that existed only to talk across an
               iframe. The iframe was the whole reason for all of it, and it
               was never needed: this shell's own bundle already registers
               branchBrief and fileReview, and every kit the branch view wants
               loads into it with zero network requests, so the frame was a
               second copy of a library already running.

               The file deck now drills from this one (branch-brief.js,
               openFileDeck), which is the same mechanism one level down: same
               chrome, same gesture, different content, and Back returns here.
