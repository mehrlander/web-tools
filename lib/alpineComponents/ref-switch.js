// alpineComponents/ref-switch.js — the header control that says which ref this
// page is RUNNING AT, and switches it.
//
// The fab already answers this question, and answers it more fully: its
// launcher goes warning-tinted off the default branch, and its Render tab
// scans every branch carrying a different copy of the page. What the fab does
// not do is sit still. It is a floating disc that has to be opened before it
// says anything, and the ref a page is running at is the kind of fact that
// wants to be legible without a tap, in the chrome, beside everything else that
// says where you are. That is the whole of this component: the same fact and
// the same two verbs, promoted into a header.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a second scan. Three things only:
//
//   1. PASTE A REF. A text box, ALWAYS PRESENT, that takes a branch, tag or sha
//      and goes on Enter. This is the primary verb, so it is not behind a tap:
//      the state it serves best is the default branch, where there is nothing
//      to report and everything to do, and a control that has to be opened
//      first puts a door in front of the one thing it exists for. It is also
//      the case the fab's scan list serves worst, since a branch you know the
//      name of is quicker to paste than to find among three hundred rows.
//   2. RIDING. The same box is the readout: it holds the ref the page is
//      running at as its VALUE, and goes warning-tinted off the default branch,
//      with a house button beside it back to the live page. One slot answers
//      "what am I running" and "take me somewhere else", rather than a chip and
//      a field competing for the same corner.
//   3. NEWEST. One button that jumps to the most recently committed branch,
//      the branch you are almost always looking for during a session. It hides
//      itself once the scan says the newest branch IS the default one.
//
// The caret at the box's right opens the branch list, which is a convenience
// over the box rather than the way in.
//
// THE REF IT SWITCHES IS THE PAGE'S OWN, not the browsed repo's. On show-repo
// those are two different things and confusing them would be easy: the Files
// view's ref picker chooses which ref of mehrlander/home you are READING, while
// this chooses which ref of mehrlander/web-tools show-repo itself is RUNNING.
// So the panel names the repo and path it acts on, every time.
//
// HOW IT SWITCHES. Not with ?use= alone. ?use= re-pins the lib a page loads,
// which reaches dist/ and lib/ but never the page's own inline shell, so a
// branch that edits this header would preview as the old header. The toss is
// what swaps the shell:
//
//   <renderer>#gh=<repo>@<ref>:<path>[?<page query>]
//
// The @<ref> addresses the page AND pins its lib, since toss-render injects
// use=<ref> into a page of the hub. Until 2026-09-28 the switch also put
// ?use=<ref> on the renderer's own query, to pin the renderer's lib (its fab,
// its peek) to the same ref. That pin kills Safari's web process on an iPhone
// whenever the renderer hosts a frame (SNAGS.md, shell-pin-kills-the-tab), and
// scripts/showing.py stopped minting it on 2026-09-08; this component kept
// minting it for twenty days. The cost of dropping it is that the drawer
// around a switched view is main's, which the fab's layer strip says. The
// page's current deep link rides along as the trailing ?query when the host
// supplies one, so switching refs lands you on the screen you were already
// looking at rather than at the page's front door.
//
// Usage:
//   <div x-data="refSwitch({ repo: 'mehrlander/web-tools',
//                            path: 'app/index.html',
//                            query: () => shell.deepLink() })"></div>
//
//   repo        the repo the PAGE lives in (not the one it is browsing)
//   path        the page's path within it
//   defaultRef  the guess until the scan lands; 'main'
//   query       function returning the page's current deep-link query string,
//               carried into the switch. Omit and the switch lands at the
//               page's default state
//   renderer    the toss renderer's URL; defaults to the deployed one
//
// The reads are the same two the fab makes (branchesForPath, degrading to
// branchesDated when there is no token), and they run ON DEMAND: hovering the
// opener starts the load, so by the time a pointer has traveled to the button
// the list is usually there, and a page nobody touches the control on pays
// nothing. The pure parts (URL construction, picking the newest) are on
// window.RefSwitch, where tools/test/ref-switch.test.mjs reads them.

(function () {
  // The one renderer. Hardcoded rather than derived because it is a property of
  // the estate, not of the page mounting this: a page in any repo tosses
  // through web-tools' deployed toss-render, the way fab.js does.

  // is what hides the button: "jump to the newest branch" is not an offer worth

  //
  // An UNDATED row can never win, and that is the whole answer for the

                 Below sm the three header slots collapse into this. A 10 rem
                 box was tried first and is the wrong trade: it is the widest
                 thing in the header and it is not what a thumb reaches for,
                 since pasting a branch name on a phone is rare and picking one
                 from a list is the whole interaction. So the box, the newest
                 jump and the way home all move into the panel, where there is
                 room to label them, and what stays pinned is 2 rem of glyph.

                 It still REPORTS without being opened, which is half of what
                 this component is for, and it now reports BOTH facts. The tint
                 answers "am I off the default branch"; the dot answers "and is
                 this the newest one". They are kept on separate channels on
                 purpose: they are independent questions, and folding the second
                 into the color would have amber mean two things at once and
                 imply one of them is better than the other, which being on the
                 newest branch is not. It is merely current.

                 The color is the whole tint signal; the glyph carried an
                 outline and a tinted background at first, which drew a box
                 around one glyph in a row of bare ones and said nothing the

                     branch you were most likely to be standing on, removed
                     itself. A row that sometimes vanishes is worse than a
                     smaller one that always answers, so the slot is always
                     here, at a reserved width, and says which of three things
                     is true:

                       loading            a spinner
                       there is a jump    a lightning button, tap to take it
                       you are on it      nothing, because the GLYPH said so

                     The third state used to carry the word "newest" here, and
                     the word was the problem: a stray label in a corner, in a
                     panel that had just been stripped of everything else. It is
                     not dropped, it moved. The dot on the header glyph answers
                     it a few pixels away and without opening anything, which is
                     strictly better than answering it inside the thing you had
                     to open. Silence here is only correct BECAUSE the glyph
                     speaks; on its own it would be the vanishing row again.

                     A fourth case, no dated non-default branch at all, leaves
                     the slot empty too, since there is genuinely nothing to
                     report.

                     Desktop keeps its header bolt instead. It is one tap
                     without opening anything, which is the better deal where
                     there is width for it, and two lightnings on one panel
                     would be the duplication this whole pass has been removing. -->

                       foreign note in the palette. It does mean amber now

                   Below sm the panel stops at the box, the newest jump and the
                   way home. The list is the one part of this control that is
                   genuinely duplicated elsewhere: the fab's Render tab scans
                   every branch carrying a different copy of the page, which is
                   the same question this list answers, down to the same signal.
                   Duplication is cheap in a desktop panel with room to spare
                   and expensive in a phone panel that then owns most of the
                   screen, so it is kept where it costs nothing and dropped
                   where it does. Typing still reaches any branch, and the fab
                   is the scan.

                   The hidden/sm:block pair sits under an x-show on purpose:
                   when x-show is true it removes its inline display style and
                   lets these classes govern, and when false its inline none
                   wins over them. Both halves land the right way round. -->
