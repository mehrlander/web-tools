  // The repo's PR WATERMARK: when its most recently touched pull request was
  // last touched, in any state, and nothing else. One row of the same list
  // branchPulls reads a hundred of. Reading the same endpoint with the same
  // sort is what makes this a probe rather than a second source: a watermark
  // cannot disagree with the index it gates, because it IS the index's first
  // row.
  //
  // It exists because the activity cache stores PR state (openPRs, branchPRs,
  // prReach) and a pull request opening, merging or closing moves NO push
  // timestamp. The estate-wide pushed_at listing therefore cannot see any of
  // it, so a crawl gated on pushes alone would freeze every branch row's PR
  // verdict until something happened to push.
  //
  // It OVER-reports and never under-reports, which is the only direction a gate
  // may err: updated_at moves on a comment or a review too, so a quiet thread
  // can trigger a crawl that then finds nothing material and skips its commit.
  // That costs calls. Under-reporting would cost correctness, silently.
  //
  // A repo with no pull requests at all reads as '' rather than as an error,
  // and '' compares equal to itself on the next pass, so an empty repo is quiet
  // rather than permanently unreadable.

  // The authoring session per branch, as { [branchName]: sessionUrl }.
  //
  // This exists because the PR body is the wrong source. A PR body only carries
  // the footer while the PR is OPEN, and open PRs are a rounding error against a
  // branch estate: 2 of 404 branches in mehrlander/home, 3 of 291 in web-tools.
  // The commit trailer is attached to the work instead, so it survives merge and
  // close. Measured over branches active in the last 30 days it resolves 121 of
  // 126 (home) and 107 of 110 (web-tools); the misses are honest, since a
  // human-authored commit has no session at all.
  //
  // Why a history walk rather than the tip alone: a quarter of branch tips are
  // merge commits ("Merge main into...", "Merge pull request #N"), which GitHub
  // generates and which carry no trailer. Tip-only resolves 88 of 124 branches;
  // walking a few commits back resolves 119.
  //
  // The honest limit: `history` follows all parents, so on a branch that merged
  // the default branch in, the walk can surface a session belonging to the
  // default branch rather than to this branch. Measured against the exact
  // answer (the branch's own commits, which needs a merge-base this view does
  // not have), the walk agreed 71 times, disagreed once, and came up empty 8
  // times. Good enough to link an icon; `.claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py`
  // is the precise instrument when the attribution has to be right.
  //
  // Deliberately a separate call rather than extra fields on branchesDated:
  // callers treat this as optional and swallow its failure, so a GraphQL shape
  // that some server rejects costs the session links and nothing else. Folding
  // it into branchesDated would take the whole branch list down with it.
