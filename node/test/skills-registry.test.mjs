// skills/manifest.csv — the skills registry, held to the folder both ways.
//
// Found undeclared by the 2026-08-09 reconciliation, and it was the clearest
// case of the class: a real registry, exact coverage (34 of 34 on the day it was
// checked), a `meta.snapshot_date` implying someone refreshes it, and no gate
// and no builder anywhere in the repo. Its accuracy rested entirely on whoever
// last added a skill remembering to add a row. This is the check that was
// missing, not a new convention.
//
// It stays hand-kept rather than generated. The manifest is a SNAPSHOT served
// to other repos over raw.githubusercontent, and a description written for that
// audience is not always the SKILL.md front-matter line verbatim. Generating it
// would decide that question by fiat; gating it leaves the judgment and removes
// the drift.
