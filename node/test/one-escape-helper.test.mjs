// one-escape-helper.test.mjs — window.esc is the estate's only HTML-escape
// helper, and the shelf stays at one.
//
// The defect this replaces: the house style carried a rule ("Unescape before
// you escape") prescribing a single shared helper that decodes entities and
// then escapes. No such helper existed. Five local copies did, to three
// different answers about which characters matter, and each call site was left
// deciding for itself whether its string lands in a text node or inside a
// quoted attribute. The rule was retired with PR #445 and the work filed as
// tracker task consolidate-escape-helpers-gxverk.
//
// The helper that replaced it does NOT decode, and that half of the rule was
// dropped on purpose rather than left undone. A source's "&amp;" is either an
// encoded ampersand or five literal characters, and nothing in the string says
// which, so a helper that decodes every value it is handed corrupts the second
// case with no way to notice. Decoding is a property of the SOURCE: it belongs
// once, at the ingestion boundary, recorded there. No source ingested here
// carries entities today, which is why no such boundary is asserted below.
//
// Two things are held here. First that the helper is correct, including the
// two quote characters no local copy escaped consistently. Second that the
// shelf stays at one, which is the part that actually decays: a sixth copy
// costs nothing to write and reads as perfectly reasonable in isolation.
