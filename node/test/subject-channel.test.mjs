// kits/subject-channel.js — telling the FAB sidebar what is on screen.
//
// The channel itself is a global plus an event (`window.__tossSubject`,
// `toss-subject`), which toss-render stamps per render and the fab adopts. The
// kit is what makes any in-document surface able to speak on it and give it
// back: which windows are listening, what is saved before the first write, and
// what is put back on the way out.
//
// Two consumers exercise it end to end and neither is repeated here.
// file-deck covers the FRAMED case (inside a toss the surface runs in the
// frame and the listening fab is the shell's) and the answer bridged back down
// from it; stage covers announcing per position and the handle a surface
// installs to be re-addressed rather than navigated away from. What is held
// here is the kit's OWN contract, the part a consumer test would only reach by
// accident: what a snapshot is taken of, and when.
