// lib/kits/swipe-deck.js — when the pane toggle may be offered.
//
// Regression origin, measured 2026-08-22 in the budget-drs app (mehrlander/home),
// the contract's only host: a phone showed a dock toggle whose intent the host
// then refused, so the control did nothing. `canDock()` was
// `typeof window.__deckPane === 'function'`, and the hook's mere existence was
// the whole answer. But dockability is rarely a property of the HOST; it is a
// property of the width, or of whether this view has a list to sit beside. An
// inert control is worse than an absent one, because the reader cannot tell
// which it is looking at.
//
// The fix is `__deckPane.when`, a media query string or a predicate, read on
// every sync rather than once. The second half, that the kit RE-ASKS when the
// answer can have changed, needs a real viewport resize and so lives in
// node/test/deck-dock-reflow.mjs, which is browser-driven and deliberately
// named without `.test.` so the suite stays browser-free. What is asserted here
// is the decision itself, which is pure logic and needs no layout.
