// alpineComponents/state-view.js — the session-titles export, reported where its
// age can be read.
//
// A session's real title cannot be captured from inside a sandbox session, so it
// arrives from a different venue: a Dispatch capture on the desktop writes a
// dated CSV, and the sessions crawl joins it onto the rows it already builds.
// That makes the title column a DATED SNAPSHOT behind a live view, which is the
// case that silently reads as current.
//
// It shipped on the Sessions pane and was removed on 2026-08-27 (PR #532),
// because that pane defaults to a Day scope where every session postdates the
// export and the line read "0 of N named": a fact about the whole title column,
// shown against whichever rows a scope happened to hold, reads as a broken join.
// The failures worth holding here are that one and its mirror: a count with no
// floor beside it, which says 63 rows are broken when every one of them has a
// name.
//
// No network, no pixels.
