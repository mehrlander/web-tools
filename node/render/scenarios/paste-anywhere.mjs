// Drive the app-wide paste from a view that is NOT the Stage, which is the
// whole claim: before 2026-08-18 this gesture did nothing anywhere but the
// Stage, and the bench had to have been visited first for it to do anything
// there. Dispatches a real ClipboardEvent carrying two flavors (a tab grid as
// text/plain, the same range as text/html), the shape a spreadsheet copy puts
// on the clipboard, so the shot shows both halves at once: the .tsv staged and
// opened as a table, and the .html left on the offer bar.
//
//   npm run shot -- app/index.html --script node/render/scenarios/paste-anywhere.mjs --wait 4000
