// The derived field of docs/registries.csv: `renders_in`, the app files that
// name each registry's path. Restamped by `npm run registries-reach` and
// gated by properties-registry.test.mjs, the way docs-reach.mjs and the docs
// registry hold `reach` and `words`.
//
// The question it answers is the docs registry's `reach` question one level up.
// The audits recorded in docs/registries.md found errors in two authored fields
// that nothing checked (`why` ran nought for five, `required` fifty-one for
// fifty-four). A registry no surface renders is committed, gated, and read by
// nobody, so nothing meets its claims either. The
// Docs tab's `reach` column proved that making such a gap visible gets it
// closed (the derivation moved twice from being looked at); this field is the
// same instrument pointed at the registries.
//
// What the scan claims, exactly: a file under lib/ or pages/ contains the
// registry's repo-relative path in CODE, comments stripped. That is docs-reach's
// `app` channel verbatim, and the scanners are imported from it rather than
// re-implemented so the two fields cannot disagree about what "the app names
// it" means. Naming is the strongest claim a textual scan can make: a named
// registry is fetched, rendered, or opened by that file in every case measured
// at introduction, but the field's honest reading stays "the app reaches it",
// not "a reader saw it".
//
// An empty list is the warning state the field exists to surface, and it is a
// fact, not an accusation: a registry read only by its gate, or projected only
// to GitHub-rendered markdown (tracker/board.csv's board.md), has no app
// surface, and whether that is fine is a judgment for the reader of the
// Registries tab. At introduction three registries were empty: manifest-fields
// (docs/manifest-fields.csv), skills (skills/manifest.csv), and
// text-fields (docs/text-fields.csv).
//
// No fixpoint is needed, unlike docs-reach: the stamp writes docs/, the scan
// reads lib/ and pages/, and the two do not intersect. The stamped paths are
// sorted, so the output is byte-deterministic.
