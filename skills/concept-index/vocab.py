"""Vocabulary index and reply check.

Two commands:
  index   walk a repo's prose, emit .concept-index/index.json: the terms the repo
          declares, tiered by how they are declared, plus the file list
  check   read text on stdin, report the entities it names: repo paths mentioned
          without a link, and declared terms used without a handle

Why declaration and not statistics. Two statistical rankings were measured and
both failed the same way: context entropy (PR #336) and in-repo IDF each reward
*rare* vocabulary, and a repo's terms of art are its *shared* vocabulary, spread
across files by definition. Nothing distributional separates "workstream" from
"page"; the difference is that the repo defines one. So declaration is ground
truth and frequency is only a tiebreak.
