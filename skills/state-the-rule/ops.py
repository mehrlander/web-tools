"""The six edits a standoff annotation admits, and the patch that declares them.

    python3 ops.py <standoff.json> <patch.json> <doc.md> [--write]

A patch is a list of DOMAIN operations keyed by uid, not RFC 6902. The standard
exists and is the wrong altitude: its paths are array indices, so a split reads
as two opaque array mutations, nothing can validate it as a split, and inserting
one unit invalidates every later path. Keyed by uid, an operation says what it
is, survives reordering, and is reviewable as a judgment rather than a result.

Two geometries, and the key says which. An op over a SPAN is keyed by `uid`;
an op over a BOUNDARY is keyed by `after`, the unit that boundary follows.

    {"op": "split",   "uid": …, "at": <offset into the document>, "why": …}
    {"op": "merge",   "uid": …}                 with its successor
    {"op": "relabel", "uid": …, "label": …}   what the unit IS
    {"op": "verdict", "uid": …, "verdict": …} what to DO about it
    {"op": "note",    "uid": …, "text": …}
    {"op": "shift",   "after": …, "to": <offset>}   the boundary after that unit
    {"op": "insert",  "after": …, "text": …, "as": "block"|"run"}
                                                text the document does not have

Every operation is checked against the invariants the stored run is already held
to (tools/test/audit-standoff.test.mjs): units tile the document with no gap,
every span resolves, every label is in the declared vocabulary, uids are unique.
An operation that would break one is refused rather than applied, so a patch is
either wholly valid against its base or it does not run.

    """WHAT KIND OF THING A SPAN IS, derived rather than remembered.

    `kind` was written once by segment.py and then carried through every edit,
    so an operation that moved a boundary left it describing a span that no
    longer existed: splitting `## Scope and precedence` gave a unit reading
    "nd precedence" still labelled `heading`, and three of the nine headings in
    CONVENTIONS.md offer that split one tap away. merge's own rule (differing
    kinds become `mixed`) was a partial version of this fix: it caught
    heterogeneity of the two stored LABELS and missed the kind the joined SPAN
    introduced, so merging two sentences across a blank line kept `sent`.

    A HEADING'S KIND CARRIES ITS LEVEL, `h1` through `h6`, rather than a bare
    `heading`: the level is in the span and dropping it made a section title and
    a sub-sub-heading the same thing to every reader of the field.

    THE ORDER IS segment.py's OWN DISPATCH, read against a span rather than a
    block, which is what lets lib/kits/standoff.js answer without a segmenter.
    A structural marker outranks heterogeneity: putting the blank-line test
    first reclassifies any fence with a blank line in its body as `mixed`.
    Measured over six of the repo's documents, 873 units including 12 fences and
    9 tables: this order agrees with segment.py on all 873, the other on 870.
    tools/test/state-the-rule.test.mjs holds the two together over that corpus.
