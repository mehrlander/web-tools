# skills — Marcus's personal skill library

Static resource. **Not a registered skill folder.** Sits at `web-tools/skills/`, not `web-tools/.claude/skills/`, deliberately: putting anything here under `.claude/skills/` would register it as an auto-fire skill in every web-tools session, which is exactly what the library-load model exists to avoid.

## Two roles this repo plays

| Path | Role | What Claude sees at session start |
|---|---|---|
| `web-tools/.claude/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md` | Registered skill | Available and matchable via description |
| `web-tools/skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md` | Library resource | Not registered anywhere; fetched on demand |

At session start, only `web-tools` and `load-skill` are registered from web-tools itself. Everything under `skills/` is content the `load-skill` mechanism can pull in.

## The library

`manifest.json` lists every available skill. Each entry has:

- `name`: the slug that matches the folder name (`arriving-together`, `xlsx`, etc.)
- `description`: the same description text the skill's own `SKILL.md` carries in its frontmatter, provided so consumers can decide relevance without fetching every body.

The `SKILL.md` inside each folder is the canonical body of the skill. Companion files (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`) live at sibling paths under the same folder.

## How this gets loaded

Via the `load-skill` mechanism at `.claude/skills/load-skill/SKILL.md`. Given a skill name, `load-skill` resolves to `<source>/<name>/SKILL.md` and fetches. `<source>` defaults to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehrlander/web-tools/main/skills`; a caller can pass another source URL to pull from a different published library.

Trigger phrases live in the `load-skill` skill's description. Only fire on explicit signals: `"load skill X"`, `"load-skill X"`, `"/load-skill X"`, `"fetch the X skill"`, `"load my X skill"`. Never on general topic overlap. The library is opt-in per session, not opportunistic.

## Editing skills

Skill bodies are edited in place here. Any repo that loads them picks up the change on next fetch: the URL always points at `main`. No target repo needs to be updated when a body changes.

Adding a new skill: create `web-tools/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with the standard YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`), then add an entry to `manifest.json`. That's it. Callers see the new skill on their next manifest fetch.

Removing a skill: delete its folder and remove its manifest entry. Consumers that had already resolved a URL to it will fail on next fetch; that's the intended failure mode.

## Snapshot lineage

The initial population of this library on 2026-07-10 mirrors the set that lived at Marcus's claude.ai account skills at that date. An earlier snapshot of the same set lived in the home repo at `me/claude-skills/` (dated 2026-07-07) and was removed the day this library landed. Going forward, this folder is the source of truth.
