"""Report code files that nothing in the repo names.

The cheapest signal that a file has drifted out of everyone's account: no doc,
README, registry, or CLAUDE.md mentions it, and no test exercises it. That is
not "wrong" and the script never says it is. A one-off tool, a shim, a demo
helper can all be fine unnamed. The point is to let your eye land on the files
you *thought* were accounted for and aren't, and to make a whole layer going
unnamed visible rather than remembered.

Two independent signals per file, because they fail differently:

    named    its path (or a distinctive basename) appears in prose: any .md,
             any registry .json under docs/, CLAUDE.md, a skill
    tested   its path or basename appears in a test file

A file can be tested but undocumented (it works, nobody says what it is for) or
documented but untested (it is described, nothing holds the description true).
Reporting one number would hide both.

The layer table is the point of the run: layers are directories, taken as they
are rather than from a list this script carries, so it says something true about
any repo and grows a row when a repo grows a folder.

Advisory, like python/dead-links.py's internal class and the scans it is
modeled on: heuristic, WILL surface false positives, always exits 0. Portable:
python3 stdlib only, argv-driven, run from any repo root.

Scope it. Unscoped it reports every tracked code file, which is honest and
usually not what you want to read: a repo with an archive, a vendored skill
shelf, or a third-party drop will fill the table with layers that are unnamed on
purpose. Pass the path prefixes you actually maintain. The corpus that does the
NAMING is always the whole repo, so scoping narrows what is judged, never what
counts as evidence.

Usage:
    python3 unclaimed-code.py [--all] [--ext .js,.mjs] [--root DIR] [prefix ...]

    --all   also list the named files under each layer, not just the unnamed
