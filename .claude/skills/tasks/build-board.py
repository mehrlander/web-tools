# Regenerate board.md, board.csv and board-tags.csv from tasks/*.md.
# Frontmatter is flat `key: value` pairs.
# Portable: python3, stdlib only, zero dependencies.
# Canonical source: mehrlander/web-tools at .claude/skills/tasks/build-board.py
# (bundled in the portable plugin; /tasks runs it via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT})
# Usage: python3 build-board.py <tasks_dir> <board_out> [--check]
#   --check writes nothing and exits 1 if any artifact is behind its source,
#   so a test or CI can own the lockstep where a commit hook may never fire.
#
# Three projections from one run, so they cannot drift:
#   board.md        the human list: GitHub, a diff, a clone, a session reading files
#   board.csv       the typed projection: show-repo and anything else machine-side
#   board-tags.csv  the open tags, one row per (task, tag) pair
# The app must never parse the rendered board to recover fields it could have
# been handed (data before display).
#
# Two files rather than one because a task carries two grains and a CSV holds
# one table. The recognized keys are one row per task; the open tags are a bag
# whose keys nobody declares, so they are one row per pair. Encoding the bag
# into a cell would have kept one file and given up the tabular reading that is
# the whole reason these are CSV (docs/registries.md).
