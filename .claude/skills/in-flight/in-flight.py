# in-flight.py: what work is live right now, and does any of it touch mine?
#
# Answers the pre-work question "is something already going on here?" before a
# session starts editing. It reports three things per repo:
#
#   1. Claims      tracker tasks marked in-progress, each with its owning branch
#   2. Live        branches carrying commits that are not on the base branch
#   3. Stale       claims whose branch has already landed, vanished, or gone quiet
#
# The load-bearing measurement is the ahead-count. A branch with zero commits
# not reachable from the base branch cannot be in flight, whatever its name or
# age says, and in a merge-commit repo that retires the overwhelming majority of
# a stale branch estate in one pass. Where a repo squash-merges, the ahead-count
# stays positive after landing, so every live candidate also gets a content
# check: how many of the paths it touched still differ from base. Both signals
# are reported; neither is silently blended into a verdict.
#
# Claims are the trust problem this exists to fix. A tracker task says
# "in-progress" until someone edits it, so a claim outlives the work by default
# and the board quietly starts lying. Reconciling every claim against its branch
# is what keeps the claim layer worth reading.
#
# Portable: python3, stdlib only, zero dependencies, no network.

# Usage:
#   python3 .claude/skills/in-flight/in-flight.py [REPO ...] [options]
#
#   REPO ...          repo paths to scan (default: the current directory)
#   --paths P [P ...] report which live branches touch these files or folders
#   --prs FILE        overlay open PRs from a JSON array of objects carrying
#                     number, title, head (branch name), draft, url; lets a
#                     session pass MCP- or API-fetched PRs in without this
#                     script needing network or a token
#   --base REF        base branch (default: origin's HEAD, else origin/main)
#   --quiet-days N    a live branch idle this long is reported quiet (default 7)
#   --fetch           run `git fetch origin --prune` first (the only write)
#   --all-claims      list healthy claims individually, not just as a count
#   --worktree        read tracker tasks from the checked-out files rather than
#                     the base branch (the default; tracker state lives on base)
#   --json            emit the finding as JSON instead of markdown
#
# Exit status is 0 whatever it finds; this is a report, not a gate.

               foreign history line, structurally unable to be current work
    unknown    no merge-base with base, on a SHALLOW clone: undecidable here,
               because the ancestor may simply be one of the omitted commits
    live       carries commits not reachable from base: the candidate set

    The unrelated/unknown split is the whole reason `shallow` is a parameter.
    A missing merge-base has two causes that look identical, and only one of
    them is a fact about the branch; see is_shallow() for the measurement that
    forced the distinction. Reporting the ambiguous case as `unrelated` states
    a conclusion the object store cannot support.

    Ordered so the expensive per-branch calls run over the smallest set that
    still needs them. `--merged` settles the landed group in one invocation;
    merge-base then runs only over the remainder, and the ahead-count only over
    what survives that. The merge-base probes run on a thread pool because they
    are independent and spend their time in a subprocess, not in Python.

    The remainder is probed one branch at a time on purpose. Deciding it in bulk
    with `for-each-ref --contains <roots>` is tempting and wrong: a base branch
    with several root commits (this repo has three) makes that filter
    misclassify, and it was measured dropping a genuinely related branch. An
    exact answer over a few hundred refs is worth more than a fast wrong one.
