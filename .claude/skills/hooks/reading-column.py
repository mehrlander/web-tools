"""Tailwind classes that narrow text to a reading column (daisy-alpine rule 3).

`max-w-3xl` on a paragraph caps it at 768px whatever the window is doing, so a
sentence wider than the cap breaks mid-phrase beside a full-width page. Measured
2026-09-01 on the Map view's tab gloss: the sentence wanted 842px, the cap gave
768, and `text-balance` then evened the halves to 426 and 412, which is why the
break reads as arbitrary. Rule 8 still wants `text-balance`; the cap is the
defect.

WHY THIS SHIPS WITH THE PLUGIN RATHER THAN LIVING IN scripts/. The class is a
model default, not a repo habit, so it arrives in every repo the same way. The
hook that refuses it (reading-column-guard.sh, beside this file) has to run from
any project root, so its engine has to travel with it. One file serves both the
hook and `npm run reading-column`; a second copy under scripts/ would be the
duplicate the registries doctrine warns about.

Two findings, both mechanical:

  reading column   max-w-prose | max-w-2xl | max-w-3xl | max-w-4xl,
                   or `container mx-auto`
  uncapped prose   a `prose` class run with no `!max-w-none`, which is the same
                   cap at 65ch wearing a different name and invisible to a
                   max-w-* grep

Two suppressions. `modal-box` in the same class run is daisyUI component sizing,
not a reading measure. A `reading-column-ok` comment on the line is the explicit
opt-out, greppable so the exceptions stay countable.

The wider sizes are deliberately not here: max-w-5xl..7xl are page shells (25
uses in this repo, 21 centered, none on a text element) and everything xl and
below is components. `!max-w-none` is how `prose` gets undone and must never be
flagged.

THE BANG IS THE WHOLE RULE, and this file taught the opposite until 2026-09-02.
Typography's stylesheet is plain unlayered CSS setting `.prose{max-width:65ch}`;
Tailwind v4 emits its utilities inside `@layer utilities`, and an unlayered rule
beats every layer whatever the source order. So a plain `max-w-none` loses and
the block stays capped. It reached a phone: chat-render's reply prose wrapped at
470px of a 1280px viewport while the ask above it ran the full width, and four
files in this repo carried the plain form while four others already carried the
bang. The scan could not tell them apart, because it was written to the belief
rather than to the cascade.

Advisory by default, in the idiom of dead-opacity.py; `--check` makes it a gate.
